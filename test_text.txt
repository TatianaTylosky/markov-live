￼


accurate and sophisticated by the day, even the best right hooks can sometimes take a while to offer
quantifiable, data-driven proof that they worked (like when you post call-to-action driven content
asking people to buy airline tickets or a bottle of wine). So though the majority of marketers and
businesspeople are working with social media, a lot of them are still questioning the value of the
platforms, and few respect them enough to fully invest, either financially or philosophically. It shows.
It shows in the low frequency of their posts, the inferior quality of their content, the lack of ingenuity
with which they approach each new medium even as it gains in popularity, and worst of all, in the
shocking lack of effort put toward showing care and respect for any community that has formed
around their business despite all the previously listed failings.
Here’s how most marketers react to new platform: Someone emails them an article that says
something like Snapchat is exploding, so they head over to the site to see what it’s about. They spend
a few minutes there and see a bunch of drunken twenty-five-year-olds posting bikini shots and text
saying, “Walking the dog!” “Anchovies . . . FTW!” They write the site off as a waste of time and
don’t come back until twelve months later, when everyone and their aunt is using it, at which point
they make a big announcement praising themselves, as though being last in line is something to be
proud of: “Look what we did! Isn’t it exciting? See how responsive we are?” It’s embarrassing. It
pisses me off. (It also makes me perversely happy because their cluelessness has a definite upside for
my clients, my friends, and for me.)
A smart entrepreneur or open-minded brand manager, however, will head over to a new platform,
see the bikini shots, and think, “How can I do better?” He or she will spend twelve months securing a
solid dominance over the platform in their category, all the while reaping tons of earned media as
bloggers and reporters chronicle their progress and analyze their strategy, and attracting the best
young talent because the students coming out of business school want to work at progressive
businesses. You’d think, given the advantages, that brands and small businesses would be scrambling
to be first to market on these platforms, but most of the time their fear of failure, their legal
department’s fear of lawsuits, or their perceived lack of time outweighs their sense of possibility.
They are playing defense instead of offense.
Here’s my dirty secret: Though I get to things early and can often see the future, I’m not
Nostradamus. I’m not even Yoda. I’m just the kind of person who shows new platforms the respect
they deserve. I won’t predict what platform will see 20 million users in a year, but once it feels to me
like it will, I put my money and my time there, testing the waters, trying new formulas, until I figure
out how to best tell my story in a way the audience for that platform wants to hear.
I can’t believe how many marketers will dismiss the media habits of five million people. Just
because your teenage daughter and her friends are excited about a new platform does not mean that
that platform is irrelevant to you or your brand. You may not see any value in sharing your thoughts on
nail polish, or posting a picture every time you get a new tattoo, or telling the world every time youset foot in a Wendy’s, but when 20 million other people do, you need to do something with that
information. Ignoring platforms that have gained critical mass is a great way to look slow and out-oftouch.
Do not cling to nostalgia. Do not put your principles above the reality of the market. Do not be
a snob.
You cannot win big in social media if you’re going to be afraid of emerging technology. Those of
us who spent time on YouTube in 2006 watched more than our fair share of dumbasses putting
Mentos in cola or dressing their cats in silly outfits. But like a parent who knows that the infant
currently squeezing handfuls of peas into mush will grow up to use a fork and knife, we had faith that
this platform hadn’t yet reached its full maturity or potential. Some people saw an amateur video
distribution site; we saw the future of television. For my part, I experimented and tested ideas to see
what worked; I created an opening hook like an old-time radio program to make myself more memeorable.
I approached it as a major platform, and so did a lot of other people who are now big-name
brands. (And they didn’t make the huge misstep to leave YouTube for Viddler in 2007, leaving
millions of free views on the table, like I did. Even I screw up sometimes!) We didn’t do anything
more than take the platform seriously and put in a massive amount of effort to figure out how to make
them work for us, committing to the same intense process of testing and observation as any champion
boxer before a fight.
A boxer spends a lot of time analyzing his own technique, but spends an equal amount of time
analyzing his competitor’s technique, too. Even when two fighters meet in the ring for the very first
time, they already know each other well. For months before the match, in addition to their regular
predawn training in the gym and practice ring, the competitors spend hundreds of hours studying each
other on film. Like insanely fit behavioral scientists, they analyze every move and swing their
opponent has made in previous fights, repeatedly rewinding and rewatching footage in an attempt to
memorize their opponent’s technique, and particularly, the tics and habits that can warn a fighter of
the swing that’s about to come. Does the opponent blink before he throws with his right hand? Does
he hesitate to come back after getting hit with a cross? Does he drop his hands when he gets tired?
Finally, on the day of the fight, a boxer will take all of this information into the ring with him, armed
with a strategy precisely calibrated to take advantage of his opponent’s weaknesses and protect
himself from the other’s strengths, so he can use his best moves to maneuver himself into a winning
position.
If, whenever they approached a platform, more marketers prepared their stories with the same
intensity as boxers, they’d create much better content. Like great boxers, great storytellers are
observant and self-aware. A great storyteller is keenly attuned to his audience; he knows when to
slow down for maximum suspense and when to speed up for comic effect. He can sense when he’s
losing people’s interest and can make adjustments to his tone or even to the story itself to recapture
their attention. Online marketing requires the same kind of audience awareness, which we can
achieve thanks to the tremendous data mining opportunities at our fingertips. The real-time feedback
that social media makes possible allows brands and businesses to test and retest, with scientific
precision, what content connects with their audience, and what leaves them cold. Ignoring the deep
analytics available for your fan page through Facebook (and through other platforms soon) is the
equivalent of stepping into the ring without even having watched a video of your opponent during a
fight.WHAT MAKES A GREAT STORY?
A great marketing story is one that sells stuff. It creates an emotion that makes consumers want to do
what you ask them to do. If you’re a mobile company, you want to motivate people to sign up for a
subscription to your service; if you’re Disney, you want to impel people to book flights and hotels
and come spend money at your park; if you’re a nonprofit, you want to move people to make a
donation. Your story isn’t powerful enough if all it does is lead the horse to water; it has to inspire
the horse to drink, too. On social media, the only story that can achieve that goal is one told with
native content.
Native content amps up your story’s power. It is crafted to mimic everything that makes a platform
attractive and valuable to a consumer—the aesthetics, the design, and the tone. It also offers the same
value as the other content that people come to the platform to consume. Email marketing was a form
of native content. It worked well during the 1990s because people were already on email; if you told
your story natively and provided consumers with something they valued on that platform, you got their
attention. And if you jabbed enough to put them in a purchasing mind-set, you converted. The rules are
the same now that people spend their time on social media.
It can’t tell you what story to tell, but it can inform you how your consumer wants to hear it, when
he wants to hear it, and what will most make him want to buy from you. For example, supermarkets or
fast-casual restaurants know from radio data that one of the ideal times to run an ad on the radio is
around 5:00 P.M., when moms are picking up the kids and deciding what to make for dinner, and even
whether they have the energy to cook. Social gives you the same kind of insight. Maybe the data tells
you that you should post on Facebook early in the morning before people settle into the workplace,
and then again at noon when they’re taking a lunch break. The better you learn the psychology and
habits of your social media consumers, the better you can tell the right story at the right time. A story
is at its best when it’s not intrusive, when it brings value to a platform’s consumers, and when it fits
in as a natural step along the customer’s path to making a purchase.
Only you know what your story should actually say. At one point it might be “Our barbecue sauce
will win you first prize at the chili cook-off,” but later you might decide it’s more important to tell the
story that “our barbecue sauce has all-natural, locally sourced ingredients.” How did MasterCard
know the time was right for the “Priceless” campaign? Nike had tried a number of stories before it hit
on “Just Do It.” There are a number of tropes that often work, but ultimately the story that you decide
needs telling can change from day to day, even from hour to hour. The perfect story is spun from your
intimate knowledge of your history, your competition’s history, and increasingly, what you see going
on in the world and what you discover your consumers want to talk about.
Whatever story you tell, you must remain true to your brand. Native storytelling doesn’t require
you to alter your identity to suit a given platform; your identity remains the same no matter what. I’ll
behave one way when I’m giving a presentation to a client in Washington, D.C., another way while
I’m standing on the train platform waiting to head home, and yet another way when I’m watching
football with my friends that night. But I’m always the same guy. Different platforms allow you to
highlight different aspects of your brand identity, and each jab you make can tell a different part of
your story. Have fun with that. One of the biggest mistakes big brands make is to insist that their tone
remain exactly the same no matter what platform they’re using. In clinging to this outdated model,
they’re missing out on one of the greatest benefits of social media—always having more than oneoption.
Entrepreneurs will have an easier time taking advantage of these options because they aren’t
bogged down by the same red tape as Fortune 500 companies. While entrepreneurs and start-ups can
respond with ease to real-time consumer feedback, corporate companies usually take a long time to
steer their big old ships around. Because of their smaller size, entrepreneurs can make decisions
quickly. Because they don’t have a herd of lawyers analyzing their every word, they can keep their
sense of humor. They are able to retain their personality and humanity no matter what platform they’re
on. Once start-ups grow enough to join the ranks of Corporate America, they often become overly
cautious and start sticking to the safest, narrowest lane they can find.
THE SWEET SCIENCE
Marketers are constantly asking me for a fixed storytelling blueprint, something that delineates the
optimal number of jabs before it’s appropriate to throw a right hook. That blueprint doesn’t exist.
Social media storytelling is as sweet a science as boxing, requiring constant experimentation and
hours of observation. Successful online content marketers pay especially close attention to variables
such as environmental fluctuations and demographic shifts. At what times do we see the highest level
of response? What happens when we use slang? How does the same image work with different
taglines? Did it make a difference to add a hashtag? Is there an increase in engagement when we put
out animated GIFs? The answers are out there if you learn how to test properly and correctly interpret
the data. You can see right away how many people heart on Instagram; how many fans share and
comment on Facebook; who repins on Pinterest and how often; how many people reblog and write
notes on Tumblr.
Allocating the time and budget for these analyses can be tough for both small and large businesses,
but it is imperative. It’s not enough to experiment—you have to respond to what the results tell you.
This is how you devise a formula to guide your future storytelling on the platform. But that formula
should be treated only as an overarching framework, because like any boxer, you can’t use the same
move over and over again. A fighter will concentrate on trying to hit his opponent’s body if he learns
that the competitor is reluctant to get hit there. But the next guy he fights might not be afraid to get hit
in the body, so he’ll have to change his approach.
Similarly, each platform is unique, and requires a unique formula. What works on Facebook won’t
necessarily work on Twitter. Stories told through pictures on Instagram don’t resonate the same way
when told in an identical manner on Pinterest. Posting the same content on Tumblr as on Google+ is
the equivalent of the tourist deciding that since he can’t speak Norwegian he’ll just speak Icelandic
and it will do. That’s stupid. Both languages share similar roots and are spoken by tall, gorgeous
blondes, but aside from that, they’re totally different.* Today, getting people to hear your story on
social media, and then act on it, requires using a platform’s native language, paying attention to
context, understanding the nuances and subtle differences that make each platform unique, and
adapting your content to match. There is a science to creating memorable, effective social media
content for mobile that converts fans into customers. Now is the time to learn it.
Today’s perfect right hooks always include three characteristics:
1. They make the call to action simple and easy to understand.2. They are perfectly crafted for mobile, as well as all digital devices.
3. They respect the nuances of the social network for which you are making the content.
I’ll share more information that can help you improve your jabs, but I would like to try to get you
to start throwing them in different places than you’re accustomed. I used to talk about going where the
eyeballs go, but consumers would need sixteen eyeballs apiece to keep up with the multitude of
devices and media that compete for their attention now. Every marketer’s goal is to reach consumers
at the moment when they’re most influenced to buy. To do that, you need to be where they are. That’s
a tough proposition when where they are is changing all the time, but it can be done. No matter where
you go to meet your customer, however, you had better show up with a knockout story, and some
killer content with which to tell it.ROUND 2:The CHARACTERISTICS of GREAT CONTENT and COMPELLING STORIES
The social media revolution wrenched the keys to the cultural kingdom away from pundits and
gatekeepers, giving ordinary people a voice. But the sound of so many people talking at the
same time—not to mention opining, debating, entertaining, instructing, and doing all the other
things people do to make their views known online—is overwhelming. In order to increase their
odds of being seen and heard, many marketers respond by posting a constant, steady stream of
fresh content to their social networks. But the social media equation requires quantity and
quality. Far too much of the content businesses and celebrities put out is no more innovative or
interesting than a Yellow Pages ad. You can find truckloads of garbage on these platforms,
especially when they are young and people are compulsively tossing content around like Mardi
Gras beads, or when they are old and act their age. Brands and small businesses want to look
relevant, engaged, and authentic, but when their content is banal and unimaginative, it only
makes them look lame. Content for the sake of content is pointless. Tone-deaf posts, especially
in the form of come-ons and promos, just take up space, and are justifiably ignored by most of
the public. Only outstanding content can cut through the noise. Outstanding content can
generally be identified because it adheres to the following six rules:
1. IT’S NATIVE
Though the functions of every platform may sometimes overlap, each one cultivates a unique
language, culture, sensibility, and style. Some support text-heavy content; others are better suited for
richly designed visuals. Some allow hyperlinks; others don’t. These differences are not minor—
putting the wrong kind of content on a platform will doom your marketing efforts. This should be selfevident,
but as you’ll see from the examples in this book, many companies just don’t take the time to
learn the platform’s native ways before throwing content on it. Those who do, however, see results.
And the ones who really dig deep to understand the subtleties and nuances of the platform that aren’t
obvious to the more casual user? They truly shine. It’s like the difference between someone who
learns a new language well enough to order meals in restaurants and talk about their day, and
someone who is so fluent he dreams, curses, and makes love in that language. Marketers who
understand platforms at that fluent level are the ones whose businesses will be most noticed and
appreciated. This has always been the case. People forget that it took a long time for television ads to
become as persuasive, and as pervasive, as they are now. Originally, only select families had access
to television, and when they did, it was a guy in a suit sitting at a desk heralding the commercials, or a
disembodied voice announcing, “This program brought to you by . . .” Not too compelling. Television
ads only started to drive sales once TV units made it into more homes and became a popular source
of family entertainment. In particular, ads started to work when a few smart marketers figured out
how to talk to their consumers in ways that were native to the platform—through short, scene-driven
stories populated with evocative characters. The ads became an intrinsic part of the televisionwatching
experience. People hummed the jingles on their way to work or while vacuuming the house.
The brands became cultural touchstones, and their products—the Cream of Wheat, the floor wax, andthe frozen dinner—flew off the shelves. All because marketers figured out how to create content that
was visually compelling, story-driven, and entertaining—ads that mirrored the content already airing
on the platform and that the television audience was coming to see.
Content is king, but context is God. You can put out good content, but if it ignores the context of the
platform on which it appears, it can still fall flat. Most marketers are oblivious to context because
marketers are on social media to sell stuff. Consumers, however, are not. They are there for value.
That value can take many forms. Sometimes it’s in a few minutes’ respite from the stress of a busy
day. Sometimes it’s in the form of entertainment, information, news, celebrity gossip, friendship, a
sense of connection, a chance to feel popular, or an opportunity to brag. Social networking sites light
up people’s dopamine pathways and the pleasure centers of their brain. Your content must do the
same, and it will if it looks the same, sounds the same, and provides the same value and emotional
benefits people are seeking when they come to the platform in the first place. In other words, it will if
it is native.
What is native to a platform? Depends on the platform. Tumblr attracts the artsy crowd and
supports animated GIFs (short, rolling loops of video). A text post from a design firm reading “Visit
our Web page to see our award-winning office furniture designs,” would be wasted there (actually,
that would be a lousy post on any platform). So would a low-quality photograph on glossy, pictureperfect
Pinterest. Twitter speaks to an ironic, urban audience that loves hashtags. An earnest post like
“We love our customers!” would probably be soundly ignored. It sounds funny here, and yet posts
like these are everywhere, proving that most brands are ignorant about what is native to a platform.
You already know that successful social media marketing requires throwing many jabs before
converting the sale with a right hook. Counterintuitively, the most effective jabs are actually the
gentlest. They are thrown with “native” content, which seamlessly blends in with the platform’s
offerings and tells stories that engage the consumer at an emotional level. From the outside, jabbing
with this kind of content won’t look or feel like the setup for that selling right hook, but it is, because
the long-term financial worth of a person’s smile, giggle, snort, and even her tears is invaluable.
Native content has been compared to a modern-day version of advertorials, or infomercials. Just
like the talk show that isn’t really a talk show, but a venue for selling slow-cookers, or the headlined
article that isn’t really an article, but an introduction to a new joint-pain medication, native content
looks and sounds exactly like any other content that appears on the platform for which it was created.
The similarities, however, stop there.
Infomercials and advertorials are usually ridiculed because of their poor production value.
There’s something cheesy about them. Sometimes that cheese is part of what makes the piece work—
it’s hard to take your eyes off Ron Popeil puttering around his staged kitchen gabbing with his cohost
and pulling chickens out of the Showtime Rotisserie. But classic advertorials and infomercials are
hardly subtle—they are loaded with right hooks. They’re informative and entertaining, like a jab, but
they’re there to sell. Whether the brand places its ad on a TV screen or in a magazine, it makes sure to
plaster a huge phone number and URL across the bottom. And even if those obvious signs weren’t
there, the whole tone of the piece is that of a sales pitch. Consumers couldn’t avoid the sell if they
tried.
Native content, however, is not cheesy when it’s done right, nor is it obvious. What it is, really, is
cool. Now, what is the formula for cool? Beats me. You know it when you see it. It’s whatever hits
your emotional center so hard you have to share it with someone else. It can be a quote, a picture, anidea, an article, a comic strip, a song, a spoof, but whatever it is, it says as much about you, the
person sharing it, as it does about the brand or business that originated it. There is no formula for cool
content, other than that you can’t make it if you don’t have a deep understanding of what makes your
audience tick and what they’re seeking when they use social media.
Creating skillful native content has little to do with selling and a lot to do with skillful storytelling.
In the right social-media-savvy hands, a brand that masters native content becomes human. Though of
course the topics of Campbell Soup Company’s posts on Facebook will probably be vastly different
from your mother’s, they should still look and feel like something a real person, whether a friend,
acquaintance, or expert, would write. When native content is skillfully delivered, a person will
consume it with the same interest as he would anyone else’s. That’s because unlike most of the
marketing tactics forced down consumers’ throats in the past, smart, native social media tries to
enhance the consumer’s interaction with a platform, not distract him from it.
You see the difference? For more examples, check out the color commentary at the end of chapters
3 through 7.2. IT DOESN’T INTERRUPT
The Keebler Elves, the Trix bunny, the Yoplait ladies one-upping each other with ecstatic
proclamations of how good the yogurt is—they were all created to entertain, so that the next time you
were in the mood for cereal or a snack, you’d remember the funny ad and be compelled to try the
product. The Marlboro Man’s steely jaw and far-off stare were designed to convince you that if you
smoked his cigarette, you too might exude an ounce of his masculine, independent essence. Ads and
marketing are supposed to make consumers feel something and then act on that feeling. In that regard,
the content marketers create today is similar to what it would have been fifty years ago. Where it
should differ, however, is in the way it affects, or rather, doesn’t affect, your consumer’s media
experience. Despite being the strong, silent type, the Marlboro Man was still an intruder. People
would be watching Bonanza and then there he’d be, interrupting their program to sell them cigarettes.
Then ads for Pine-Sol, Bengay, or Jif would follow. No matter how good the ads were, there was a
distinct break between the show people were watching and the ad. But today marketers don’t have tointrude on the consumer’s entertainment. In fact, it’s imperative that we don’t. People have no
patience for it anymore, as evidenced by the speed with which they jumped on the chance to bypass
advertising altogether with the advent of DVRs in the late 1990s, and other commercial-skipping
devices. If we want to talk to people while they consume their entertainment, we have to actually be
their entertainment, melding seamlessly into the entertainment experience. Or the news experience. Or
the friends-and-family experience. Or the design experience. Or the networking experience. Whatever
experience people are seeking on their preferred platforms, that’s what marketers should attempt to
replicate. They may not be in a buying frame of mind today, but you never know about tomorrow, and
they will be far more likely to make a purchase from a brand they believe understands them and
represents what they value than one to which they have no emotional connection.
3. IT DOESN’T MAKE DEMANDS—OFTEN
Advertising impresario Leo Burnett offered the following advice for making great content:
Make it simple.Make it memorable.Make it inviting to look at.Make it fun to read.
I’m going to add one more directive: Make it for your customer or your audience, not for yourself.
Be generous. Be informative. Be funny. Be inspiring. Be all the characteristics we enjoy in other
human beings. That’s what jabs are all about. Right hooks represent what is valuable to you—getting
the sale, getting people in the door. Jabs are about what is valuable to the consumer. How do you
know what content people find valuable? Look on their phones. Phone home screens show you
everything you need to know about what kind of content people value. In general, the three most
popular app categories are:
a. Social networks, which tells you that people are interested in other people.
b. Entertainment, including games and music apps, which tells you that people want to escape.
c. Utility, including maps, notepads, organizers, and weight loss management systems, which tells
you that people value service.
Much of your content should fall within one of these three categories. Sometimes the possible jabs
a business should take with this content will be obvious. A cosmetics company could easily tell a
story about utility by giving their customers short videos (under fifteen seconds) on Facebook on how
to properly apply their makeup, or put out an infographic on Pinterest illustrating the interesting facts
about their product history and how women have used it over time. But how would a cosmetics
company provide entertainment? If it’s selling to eighteen- to twenty-five-year-old females, it could
post demos of new music that appeals to eighteen- to twenty-five-year-olds, and deconstruct female
music stars’ stage makeup, maybe admiring the risks they take and explaining how people could try to
get the same toned-down effect at home. As for how the company can tap into its customers’ desire to
interact with people, it just needs to be human. It needs to get in on conversations, find shared
interests with consumers, and respond and react to what people are saying, not just about the brand
per se, but about related topics, like how women can erase the signs of fatigue and stress before a big
presentation even when they’ve been up since three in the morning with a baby, or what age is
appropriate for girls to start shaping their eyebrows. It could also talk about unrelated topics. Just
because its main product was makeup wouldn’t mean that it couldn’t also talk about gaming or food,
because it’s possible that fans could be enthusiastic about those topics, too. Jabs can be anything that
helps set up your “commercial ask.”
When you deliver a precise jab with native content, it might take your consumer a split second
before he realizes that the story he’s paying attention to is being told by a brand, not an individual.
Yet if your content is great, the realization won’t piss him off. Instead, he’ll appreciate what you’re
offering. Because when you jab, you’re not selling anything. You’re not asking your consumer for a
commitment. You’re just sharing a moment together. Something funny, ridiculous, clever, dramatic,
informative, or heartwarming. Maybe something featuring cats. Something, anything, except a sales
pitch. Skillful, native storytelling increases the likelihood that a person will share your content with a
friend, thus increasing the likelihood of that friend remembering your brand the next time she decides
she needs whatever it is you sell. It might even increase the chance that when you finally do hit her
with a right hook and ask her to buy something from you, she will click through to make an immediatepurchase, even though she’s sitting under a dryer at the salon (this moment brought to you thanks to the
generous contribution of mobile device developers everywhere).
The emotional connection you build through jabbing pays off on the day you decide to throw the
right hook. Remember when you were a kid, and you’d go to your mom and ask her to take you out for
an ice-cream cone, or to the video arcade? Nine times out of ten, she said no. But then, every now and
then, out of the blue, she would say yes. Why? In the days or weeks prior, something about how you
interacted with your mother before the unexpected outing to the ice-cream shop or arcade made your
mom feel like she wanted to do something for you. You made her happy, or maybe even proud, by
giving her something she valued, whether it was doing extra chores or good grades or just one day of
peace with your sibling. You gave so much that when you finally asked, she was emotionally primed
to say yes.
No way is a consumer going to say yes if you ambush him with a giant pop-up that blacks out the
middle of the Web page he’s reading. The only thing he’ll feel is irritation as he frantically hunts for
that little X in the corner that will make you go away. If consumers could wipe out all the banner ads
blinking around the periphery of their Web pages, too, they would. No one wants to be interrupted,
and no one wants to be sold to. Your story needs to move people’s spirits and build their goodwill,
so that when you finally do ask them to buy from you, they feel like you’ve given them so much it
would be almost rude to refuse.
Jab, jab, jab, jab, jab . . . right hook!
Or . . .
Give, give, give, give, give . . . ask.
Get it?
4. IT LEVERAGES POP CULTURE
There’s a great scene in the movie This Is Forty where two parents tell their daughters they’re going
to eliminate the Wi-Fi so the family can bond better without the distraction of electronics. For
entertainment, the mom and dad suggest building a fort, or running around in the woods, or putting up
a lemonade stand. The girls have no idea what their parents are talking about; without their phones,
they may as well be condemned to life in an isolation cell. Histrionics ensue.
It’s no joke. Generations are defined by their pop culture, and without it, they’re lost. Take away a
young person’s tech and you’ve taken away her lifeline to everything that matters to her. In days past,
kids met their friends at the soda fountain and listened to records. Then they hung out at the mall and
listened to cassettes. Later they hung out at the 7-Eleven parking lot and listened to CDs. Now they
hang out on their phones, simultaneously listening to downloads, checking the celebrity news, chatting
with their friends, playing games, all on their smartphones and tablets. And your content has to
compete with all of it. But as the saying goes, if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. The young generation
isn’t the only one consuming their culture via phone, either. Everyone is, including the ones who used
to listen to their music on records, cassettes, and CDs. So use that to your advantage. Show your fans,
whoever they are, that you love the same music they do. Prove that you understand them by staying on
top of the gossip about celebrities from their generation. Create content that reveals your
understanding of the issues and news that matter to them. Just don’t place it in a mobile banner ad.
The days of stopping people from what they’re doing to look at your ad are at best diminishing, andmore than likely over, and regardless are overpriced for the ROI. Integrate your content into the
stream, where people can consume it along with all their other pop culture candy.
5. IT’S MICRO
There is something else you could do as you reevaluate your social media creative: stop thinking
about your content as content. Think about it, rather, as micro-content—tiny, unique nuggets of
information, humor, commentary, or inspiration that you reimagine every day, even every hour, as you
respond to today’s culture, conversations, and current events in real time in a platform’s native
language and format.
A well-known (in advertising circles) yet perfect example of micro-content practically stole the
show at the 2013 Super Bowl. When the power went out in the Superdome during the third quarter,
leaving thousands of spectators in the dark for a half hour, while the players for the Baltimore Ravens
and San Francisco 49ers hunkered down trying to keep their bodies limber and their heads in the
game, Oreo saw an opportunity. It tweeted, “Power Out? No Problem.” Attached was a photo of a
lone Oreo cookie waiting in the dark, with accompanying text that read, “You can still dunk in the
dark.” Suddenly, all those people in limbo waiting for the power to be restored and the game to start
over saw a funny reminder that Oreo is the cookie for all occasions. The tweet didn’t tell anyone to
go buy Oreos. It didn’t include any call to action, actually. It didn’t need to. Within minutes it had
been retweeted across Twitter and liked on Facebook tens of thousands of times. Why? No one had
ever seen anything like it. It’s one thing for a Ravens fan or a 49ers fan to tweet or post status updates
chronicling her reaction to the game; we’ve gotten used to seeing individuals respond to real-time
events around the world. But to see a brand do it as casually and naturally as a real person? That was
a first for such a mass-market brand within the context of such a mainstream event. The tweet was
only possible because Oreo had thought far enough ahead to have a social media team at the ready to
respond to whatever happened on television. Talk about proper investment in a platform. Key to the
ad’s success was not only the fact that it was clever and elegant, but also that it aligned perfectly with
Oreo’s brand identity, as well as the identity of Oreo lovers everywhere. Oreo is the playful cookie,
the fun cookie, the cookie you want to watch football with.
Did the micro-content offer consumers anything of value, as a proper jab should? It’s unlikely it
would have received any attention if it hadn’t. Don’t underestimate the value of a fun surprise, a grin,
and a sudden craving for chocolate and shortening. For a few days, the whole world, in traditional
media and social, had positive things to say about Oreo. At the very least, everyone who saw it got
the chance to say they witnessed the beginning of a new era in marketing.
The next time a brand responds in real time, will the Twittersphere go crazy? Probably not, which
is why it’s good to be first to market, even on platforms that don’t appear to have tremendous value at
first glance. Your job as a marketer is not just about selling more product (though that’s a priority,
and don’t forget it), but increasingly about making sure that you are first to market as often as possible
in terms of timing, the quality of your micro-content, and the originality with which you respond to the
world around you. This is true no matter what platform you work with, from Twitter to Facebook,
from Instagram to Pinterest.
Oreo’s strategy through the Super Bowl exemplifies the only formula for social media success that
doesn’t change depending on platform or audience:Micro-Content + Community Management = Effective Social Media Marketing
Some people weren’t impressed by the tweet. Imagine, using a platform the way it’s supposed to
be used! But so few companies manage it, it is worth applauding when one succeeds. This move took
a lot of forethought. Oreo had to have a team in place, watching, waiting for the first opportunity to
strike as the game went on. Old Spice managed something similar a few years ago with its “The Man
Your Man Could Smell Like” campaign, in which the actor Isaiah Mustafa replied to consumer
questions in real time on the Web. But that Q&A was the result of a carefully orchestrated campaign.
Oreo had a TV ad that ran during the Super Bowl (and integrated Instagram) but otherwise had no
plan other than to be in a position to respond to real-time events in real time. That’s hard to do, and
they did it perfectly, keeping things simple, immediate, and relevant.*
Businesses can forge a direct connection between their community and their brand when they stop
thinking about social media as the backup to the main events. It should be a main event in and of itself,
serving as the nexus connecting every other channel by which businesses talk to their customers.
There’s no reason for marketers to draft new overarching social media campaigns every year.
Everyone’s should be as simple as this:
Jab at people, all the time, every day.
Talk about what they’re talking about.
When they start talking about something different, talk about that instead.
Repeat.
Repeat.
Repeat.
Not every brand has to jab at the same rate as its competitor. Remember, quality and quantity—
some brands can get away with just a few jabs here and there; others need to jab all the time. I don’t
have to jab nearly as often as I did when I was first starting out. BP doesn’t have to jab as often as it
did after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Apple probably didn’t have to jab at all at the
height of the iPhone frenzy, when the product was still new. Successful storytelling builds brand
equity, and businesses with high brand equity don’t need to draw as much attention to themselves and
their achievements as those that are still establishing their value to the consumer. Yet even if you
don’t have to jab frequently, you can’t ever stop entirely, and you certainly can’t stop watching for
those special opportunities where your brand can take advantage of breaking news or the culture at
large to prove its relevance or show it’s paying attention. Social marketing is now a 24-7 job.
6. IT’S CONSISTENT AND SELF-AWARE
Consider how each and every post, tweet, comment, like, or share will confirm your business’s
identity. Though your business’s micro-content will vary wildly every day, it must consistently
answer the question “Who are we?” You can and should learn to speak as many languages as
possible, but no matter which language you’re using, your core story must remain constant. And no
matter how you tell your story, your personality and brand identity must remain constant, too.
When you’re self-aware, you know your message. When you know your message, it’s easy to keep
it consistent in every setting. No marketer should find this a daunting concept—we do it every daywhen we navigate the analog world. You’re going to wear a different outfit and use different
vocabulary when you’re sitting down for tea with your grandmother in her home than when you’re
living it up with friends in a nightclub. At least, you will if you’ve got nice manners. Creating microcontent
is simply a way for your brand to adapt according to the circumstances and the whims of your
audience. Micro-content is your brand’s best chance of being noticed in an increasingly busy,
disjointed, ADD world.
When you create stellar content native to a platform’s context, you can make a person feel; if your
content can make a person feel, he is likely to share it with others, providing you with amplified word
of mouth at a fraction of the cost of most other media. Best of all, you not only own the content, you
own the relationship with your customer. You’re not spending a million dollars to rent it for thirty
seconds from a television network. You could spend a million dollars to acquire committed fans on
Facebook, and that would be money well spent, but if you also storytell properly, the only additional
cost you’ll have is for the nonworking creative. Your content simply lives on, replicating itself over
and over as your fans and followers pass it along through word of mouth, diminishing your costs with
every retweet, share, pin, heart, and post. The concept of owning content and relationships instead of
renting them has gained enormous traction with the start-up entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley, but it has
been slower to infiltrate the mind-set of most Fortune 500 companies and traditional small businesses
around the world. That’s going to change once they realize that they are no longer beholden to media
companies to disseminate their content and connect with their consumers. Thanks to social media,
they’ll be able to do it all by themselves. Some already are, as we’ll see in the upcoming chapters.ROUND 3:STORYTELL on FACEBOOK
Founded: February 2004
The platform was called Thefacebook.com until August 2005.
In a 2006 survey of the top five “in” things on college campuses, Facebook tied with beer but
scored lower than iPods.
The “Like” button was originally supposed to be called the “Awesome” button.
Mark Zuckerberg initially rejected photo sharing; he had to be persuaded that it was a good idea
by then-president Sean Parker.
There were more than a billion monthly active users as of December 2012.
There were 680 million monthly active users of Facebook mobile products as of December
2012.
One out of every five page views in the United States is on Facebook.
Let me say that again: ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE PAGE VIEWS IN THE UNITED STATES
IS ON FACEBOOK!
What more could possibly be said about Facebook? We all know what it is and what it does.
We all know it’s the biggest, baddest social network, the one that changed our culture as
monumentally as television. While still skeptical about most other social media platforms, small
business owners, marketers, and brand managers consider Facebook a legitimate marketing
tool, though, strangely enough, not because it has the most sophisticated analytics available.
Rather, they trust it because it’s hard to dismiss a platform as skewing too young, or too
experimental, or too trendy, when your niece, your brother, your seventy-two-year-old dad, and
more than a billion other people are on it. Familiarity breeds acceptance. Only the most
stubborn holdouts, mostly from companies working B2B or just contrarians, question whether
their customer is actually on Facebook and whether it’s worth maintaining a presence there.
It stands to reason that if this is the platform with which most people are familiar, it’s the one that
requires the least explanation. Yet this chapter ended up being the longest in this book, because
although most marketers think they understand Facebook, they obviously don’t. If they did, consumers
would be seeing much different content, not just on Facebook, but across all platforms. For now,
however, the majority of brands and businesses still haven’t realized the unprecedented insight
Facebook gives us into people’s lives and psychology, insight that allows marketers to optimize
every jab, every piece of micro-content, and every right hook.
Think about why people go to Facebook: to connect, socialize, and catch up on what the people
they know and presumably care about are doing. In the process, they also find out what their friends
and acquaintances are reading, listening to, wearing, and eating; what causes they are championing;
what ideas they’re hatching; what jobs they’re hunting; and where they are going. Facebook wants
users to see things that they find relevant, fun, and useful, not annoying and pointless, or else they’ll
abandon the site. Which means you’d better create content that’s relevant, fun, and useful, too.
Now, if it were that easy, this really would be a short chapter. Hire better creatives, make better
content, and you’d be good to go. The problem is that there are three forces that have made it moredifficult than it used to be for even the most talented creatives to organically deliver awesome content
on Facebook: the masses, the evolution of the masses, and Facebook’s response to the evolution of
the masses.
The very thing that makes marketers want to have a presence on Facebook—the sheer number of
users—makes the platform a marketing challenge. A billion users, and all the content they generate,
creates a conundrum: with so many pieces of content streaming into consumers’ News Feeds and
competing for attention, it’s unlikely they will see any content you post, even the good stuff.
In addition, users are human. They age and mature. They grow up, break up, have kids, quit the
guitar, take up fencing, or go vegetarian. The user who became your fan in 2010 will not be the same
fan in 2014. But even though he’s changed, he probably hasn’t thought to go back and remove outdated
information about his tastes and preferences on Facebook. We’re always going to follow more people
and brands than we need to. We may not be watching this TV show anymore nor following that actor,
but we don’t unfollow their pages as we move on in life. As those bygone interests fade from our
consciousness, we expect them to fade from our pages and News Feeds, too.
Facebook knows this. Long ago, when college students were the biggest population on Facebook
and the user pool was relatively small, people’s News Feeds were organized chronologically. But as
the user base grew—and grew and grew—Facebook had to figure out how to prevent users’ streams
from getting clogged up with posts they weren’t interested in. It didn’t want to be Twitter, with its
waterfall of content from every person, organization, brand, and business in which users ever
expressed interest; it wanted to curate our News Feed and make sure the majority of what we saw
was always important and relevant to us. To help mitigate the consequences of literal TMI, Facebook
finally settled on an algorithm called EdgeRank. Every interaction a person has with Facebook, from
posting a status update or a photo, to liking, sharing, or commenting, is called an “edge,” and
theoretically, every edge channels into the news stream. But not everyone who could see these edges
actually does, because EdgeRank is constantly reading algorithmic tea leaves to determine which
edges are most interesting to the most number of people. It tracks all the engagement a user’s own
content receives, as well as the engagement a user has with other people’s or brands’ content. The
more engagement a user has with a piece of content, the stronger EdgeRank believes that user’s
interest will be in similar content, and it filters that person’s news stream accordingly (a randomizer
ensures that occasionally we’ll see a post from someone we haven’t talked to in years, thus keeping
Facebook fresh and surprising). For example, EdgeRank makes sure that a user who often likes or
comments on a friend’s photos, but who ignores that friend’s plain-text status updates, will see more
of that friend’s photos and fewer of his status updates. Every engagement, whether between friends or
between users and brands, strengthens their connection and the likelihood that EdgeRank will push
appropriate content from those friends and brands to the top of a user’s News Feed. That’s of course
where you, the marketer, want to see your brand or business.
That’s why it’s never been more important to produce quality content that people want to actually
interact with—a brand’s future visibility on the platform depends on its current customer engagement
levels (and soon this trend will spread to all the other platforms, as well). Unfortunately, the
engagement that marketers most want to see—purchases—is not the engagement that Facebook’s
algorithm measures, and therefore not the engagement that ultimately affects visibility. More than
anything else, marketers want users to respond to their right hooks. That’s why they put so many out
there. What they don’t realize, however, is that on Facebook, it’s the user’s response to a jab thatmatters most.
Here’s why: Through EdgeRank, Facebook weighs likes, comments, and shares, but it currently
does not give greater weight to click-throughs or any other action that leads to sales. EdgeRank
doesn’t care, actually, whether you sell anything, ever. Facebook’s greatest priority is making the
platform valuable to the consumer, not to you, the marketer. What it cares about is whether people are
interested in the content they see on Facebook, because if they’re interested, they’ll come back. What
proves interest? Likes, comments, shares, and clicks—not purchases. You could put out a piece of
content with a hyperlink to your product page that garners $2 million in sales in thirty minutes.
Facebook would take note of the heightened interest, and the algorithm would push you to the
forefront of your current fans’ News Feeds. But link clicks do not create stories, so if no one shares
that piece of content, or even likes or comments on it, the content will reach your current community,
but Facebook will not deem it interesting enough to show it to a wide number of people outside that.
If you want to maximize your eyeballs, it’s not enough to get people to read your article or buy your
product—you have to get them to engage with it so that it spreads. On Facebook, the definition of
great content is not the content that makes the most sales, but the content that people most want to
share with others.
Unfortunately for marketers, as with all platforms that you can’t test in a controlled environment, it
is still difficult to make a direct correlation between high levels of engagement and sales. However, it
stands to reason that the only way you can make any sales is if as many consumers as possible see
your content (and if customers are seeing it, it had better be what you want them to see). Consumers’
eyes are on Facebook. If the only way to reach those consumers is to get them to engage, then it’s up
to you to create not just great content, but content that’s so great they want to engage with it. To put it
in boxing terms, you have to jab enough times to build huge visibility, so that the day you do throw a
right hook—the day you do try to make a sale, say, with a post that’s not particularly shareable but
where the link takes people to your product—it will show up in the maximum number of News Feeds.
Unfortunately, while it tries hard to guess what is important to users, Facebook still can’t
determine their intent. Which action, or edge, indicates more interest—commenting on a post or liking
a post? If a person actually clicks on a picture, is she showing more interest than if she shares it? Is a
picture more valuable than a video? Does liking a video post show equal interest as watching the
entire video? Facebook doesn’t know, but it desperately wants to, so it keeps tweaking the algorithm
to figure the mystery out. This is why even though most of your content might get seen today, you can’t
trust that it will tomorrow. One minute your brand could be popping up at the top of a user’s page; the
next it could be buried six pages down. For example, Facebook may decide that sharing is a much
stronger call to action and brand endorsement than liking, so it will give sharing more weight than a
like. If your content happens to elicit many shares, you’re golden. But then Facebook could change its
mind and decide that likes are actually as valuable if not more so than shares. Your content doesn’t
usually get that many likes. Now what?
The speed with which we have to keep up with these changes, and create matching content, is
enough to give even the most seasoned marketer a case of whiplash. How are we supposed to jump
through the hoops to reach our consumers if Facebook keeps moving the hoops around?
By staying vigilant. By accepting that you’re going to reinvent your content every day, if not more.
And by getting to know your community like your own family. How do you do that? You tell them
stories they want to hear. You give openly and generously. You jab, jab, jab, jab, jab.JABS IN ACTION
The key to great marketing is remembering that even though you’re all about your brand, your
customer is not. As with any first date, getting a second date depends on you doing your best to learn
more about what the other person is interested in, and directing the conversation in that direction. In
the end, boxing and dating are really not that different. After all, the goal is to score. Sometimes the
score is measured in points, and sometimes in a marriage proposal (or something else), but in either
case you won’t win if you play your most aggressive move first.
Let’s say your company sells boots. It would make a lot of sense for you to talk about weather. It
would make a lot of sense to talk about rock climbing. It would even make sense to talk about hunting
or maybe even something like how the boots protect people’s feet during rowdy concerts. These are
all topics that are directly related to boots, or at least only about one mental step away. So for your
first jab, you put out the following status update:
“So long, 30 Rock! Thanks for seven hilarious years!”
If the CMO of this boot company knows only as much about social media as the average
businessperson, as soon as she sees that first status update she’s going to storm up to you and question
the living crap out of it. What does 30 Rock have to do with our boot company? How off-brand can
you get? Why are we doing this? How does this sell more boots? And your answer will be, it doesn’t.
Yet.
As the CMO of the boot company stands there looking, at best, curious and, at worst, furious, you
will calmly point to the analytics (called Page Insights), which will reveal that that particular post is
getting higher than usual engagement over more traditional boot-centered posts, just as you thought it
would. Why? Because through previous jabs asking things like “What’s your favorite TV show?” you
had already gathered the consumer insight that 80 percent of your fans were crazy about 30 Rock. And
you knew that the series finale was approaching. So by putting out a “Good-bye, 30 Rock” piece, you
are connecting with your community and showing them that not only do you get them, but you are one
of them. All of a sudden your brand is talking like a human being, not a boot company. And as the
overindexing (meaning a post performs above normal for that brand) reveals, people like that. They
respond. This is good for you, because the uptick in engagement tells Facebook that this brand matters
to people. So when you put out your next piece of content, a fifteen-second user-generated video of
people showing off their boots, Facebook makes sure your customers see it in their News Feed.
Again, the piece isn’t selling anything. Nor is the next one, a Valentine’s Day card that doesn’t show a
single boot. Then you put out another three or four pieces of content that don’t sell anything, either,
like this:
Third jab: Post—A fifteen-second video about rock climbing.
Fourth jab: Poll—“Would you rather wear your boots in the summer or the winter?”
The point is to give and give and give, for no other reason than to entertain your customers and
make them feel like you get them. And the more you give, the more you really will get them. Before,
every piece of content had to be a right hook because all we knew about customers who bought boots
was that they needed protective footwear. But if we jab wisely, Facebook can give a detailed and
nuanced understanding of the people who buy our products. By testing and jabbing and giving, we
learn what they find entertaining. Content that entertains sees engagement. Content that sees
engagement tells Facebook and the rest of the world that your customers care about your brand, sothat when you finally do put out something that would directly benefit your bottom line—a coupon, a
free-shipping offer, or some other call to action—4 percent of your community sees it instead of a
half percent, which gives you a much better chance at making a sale.
TARGET YOUR JABS AND RIGHT HOOKS
Sometimes, though, you don’t want everyone to see the same information. On any other platform,
where your posts are entirely public, every jab hits everyone in the face. On Facebook, however, you
can be extremely selective, customizing your jabs and targeting subsets of your fan base. Want to
target a post for thirty-two- to forty-five-year-old married women with college degrees who speak
French and live in California, and post it on New Year’s Eve? When you know how to use Facebook
properly, you can (and I imagine the largest liquor store in California would).
Targeting your posts is a strategy to keep in mind when you’re jabbing; it’s flat-out essential when
you’re throwing a right hook. Let’s say you’re a national fashion retailer, and today is Black Friday.
You’ve created a piece that highlights one of your most coveted purses. You know that the buyers of
that purse are generally twenty-five-year-old females. Does it make any sense to send that content
about a purse to your fifty-five-year-old male customers who primarily come to you for belts? Of
course not. So when you post the announcement about tonight’s Black Friday sale, with a picture of
the purse, you post it only to fans of your page who are twenty-five- to thirty-five-year-old women.
By speaking directly to the right demographic, you’ve increased the probability that people will
engage with that content, which keeps your EdgeRank numbers up, instead of giving Facebook the
impression that people don’t care about your brand anymore by posting it to men who are never going
to click or engage with a post about a purse.
Now, you could post the piece to your fifty-five-year-old male customers if you change the content
so that it resonates with them. Maybe it reads, “Hey Dad, it’s never too late to remind her that she’s
still your best girl. Our Black Friday sale starts tonight, 6:00 P.M.” You go even further and design the
content so that it goes out to consumers in Texas in the shape of Texas, and the content that goes to
New Jersey is in the shape of New Jersey, and so on and so forth for any of the states whose residents
have a particularly strong streak of state pride. For any jab or right hook to have impact, it has to
speak to the consumer and hit his or her emotional center.
SMART SPENDING
It’s worth taking a step back and examining the cost-effectiveness of this scenario. With very little
lead time, a retailer can create two distinct pieces of content, send it directly to two separate
demographics, and watch in real time to see how the recipients respond. If the excited comments start
to pile up, or the content starts getting shared, that retailer knows the right hook made its mark. Its
consumers engage, thus kicking up the retailer’s EdgeRank, which shows Facebook that its users
value the retailer. It makes sure the content shows up in more people’s stream, which therefore
allows the retailer to show its content over and over again to an ever-larger audience without having
to pay any more for it.
To accomplish the same thing on television, a national retailer might create two different TV spotstargeting different demographics. For example, it would launch one mainstream targeted ad that
would run on CNN during primetime, and a multiculturally targeted ad that would run on UPN
channels during the local 10 P.M. news. The creative team would have to develop the ads weeks
before they ran. Typically, the spot would need to run enough times so that the retailer’s desired reach
population would have seen the spot three times—about a two-week flight of spots. It would cost the
retailer between $7,000 and $13,000 to reach this audience. Then, once the pieces had run, it would
have to sit and cross its fingers that people had actually watched the ad even though they had just
forgotten to turn the TV off while streaming a movie on their second screen. And if it wanted to run
more content, it would have to pay all over again.
Which scenario sounds more time- and cost-efficient to you?
Now, there’s nothing wrong with spending money when you’re spending it smartly. All along
you’ve probably been buying the Facebook ads that line up along the right side of the site. Those ads
have until now been one of the most efficient ways to spend dollars for any brand or business, big or
small. On average, the cost of running an ad on the right side of the page on Facebook runs the gamut
between $.50 to $1.50 per like, though depending on the specificity of your targeting, the length of
your campaign, and your budget it’s possible to acquire likes for as low as $.10 and as high as
several dollars. That’s a steal, even when you compare it to the cost of email acquisition, which can
run as low as $0.49. How can a dollar spent acquiring a Facebook fan be worth more than forty-nine
cents anywhere else? Because a social user on your fan page has more potential reach than anywhere
else.
I should know. Back in 1998, I was using email marketing, as well as search engine marketing
(SEM) and pay-per-click ads, to build WineLibrary.com. People loved my product and my business
and were happy to subscribe to my emails and to buy from me. My business model then was no
different from that of any of the successful email marketing companies of the last half decade like
Fab.com, Groupon, or Gilt. The difference is that their fans aren’t as beholden to their email as mine
were in 1998. If my fans wanted to talk to or share information with friends, they had to use email.
Today’s fans don’t. So today’s email marketers have had to offer huge rewards for sharing, such as
$10 off a first order if the customer can get five friends to subscribe to the site. Without that incentive,
people won’t spread content or invite friends to join them on your site via email—it feels too much
like spreading spam. Social media, however, is built for sharing, so those targeted Facebook ads,
though costing $.50 to $1.50 per fan, are actually worth much more because those fans are more likely
inspired to share your content for free, and possibly more than once—if you give them what they want
in terms of content and service.
THE CHANGING FACE OF SMART SPENDING
Unfortunately, Facebook ads in their current incarnation are going the way of the dinosaur, and the
days of cheap fan acquisitions are coming to an end. With the substantial growth of mobile for
Facebook and the increase in people abandoning their laptops, the ads on the right side of Facebook’s
desktop are becoming obsolete. You could hope that consumers will think to go directly to your fan
page for a steady stream of your content, but honestly, unless you’re doing research, do you go to that
many fan pages just for kicks? Probably not. And we’re all going to do it even less now that we’re
spending more time on Facebook’s mobile app than we do on the website itself.There is no substitute for the real estate of a desktop on a mobile device—there’s no room. This
means that until the next great technological revolution, like Google glasses or tattooed screens in the
palms of our hands, all of your Facebook stories, content, and marketing must be developed for the
mobile experience. This is why in January 2013, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that
Facebook should now be considered a mobile company.* And just six months later, Facebook
reported 41 percent of its ad revenue came from mobile, equaling $1.6 billion in the second quarter
of 2013.
But if marketers are limited to smartphone screens, where are marketers supposed to put their ads?
Some brands have decided that the answer is: right on top of the page the consumer is trying to read.
It has surely happened to you—you head to your favorite site to check the news, and instead of seeing
your content, a big intrusive box overtakes the screen, pitching electronics or software or something
that you did not come to the site to see. Why do marketers think this is a great way to get people to do
business with them? All is does is piss people off and elicit negative feelings toward your brand. It is
the antithesis of jabbing. All impressions are not good impressions. Quality, relevance, good timing
—these things matter far more than many marketers realize. Once again, we have to keep in mind why
people gravitate to Facebook, or any site, for that matter. It’s not to see ads.
So what’s a marketer to do? We need to rethink what an ad looks like, and what it accomplishes.
We need to go native. We need to bring value. From now on, the difference between your content and
your ads on Facebook will be . . . nothing. Your content, or rather, your micro-content, has to be the
ad. Fortunately, Facebook has been perfecting a tool that allows you to create ads out of content that
has already been vetted by your fans, which will not only help you improve your content’s reach, but
will actually protect you from putting out content that is simply a waste of your and your customer’s
time. It’s called a sponsored story. And unlike a TV ad or magazine spread, this spending strategy is
worth every penny.
SPONSORED STORIES
Sponsored stories were launched in early 2011, but it was in the fall of 2012 that they came into their
own, mostly because Facebook announced that it was finally making an algorithmic adjustment that
would purposely limit how many people would organically see a brand’s posts, even if they had
already become fans by liking the brand’s page. Until recently, though the algorithm was calibrated to
limit spam or uninteresting content, good content could still organically reach a large percentage of
fans. As of September 2013, however, Facebook’s algorithm will only allow your content to reach
about 3–5 percent of your fans. To reach more, you have to post some extremely engaging content. Or,
you have to pay. In this way, Facebook is able to protect the consumer’s experience by raising the
barrier to entry to the News Feed.
A lot of the marketing community didn’t see it that way. They were livid. How could Facebook
force them to pay more to take advantage of its billion users? How disloyal. How conniving. How
capitalist.
Did anyone really think that Facebook wasn’t going to figure out a way to make more money?
Besides, what else was it supposed to do when the right-side-of-the-page real estate for Facebook
ads was disappearing faster than curse words in my keynote speeches as people ditched the wide
screens of their PCs for their mobile devices? I didn’t understand people’s fury. Marketers andbusiness owners who would never get mad about paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to a
network to get their ad on TV, even when they’d never know whether the ad had gotten anyone’s
attention, were having coronaries over having to pay for the same kind of distribution. Unlike TV,
your content’s reach increases only when you’ve put out content that people actually want to see and
think others do, too. The more people who interact with your content, the more you can amplify the
word-of-mouth amplification it receives as their actions are shared with other people. Create great
content that gets people to engage and Facebook will let you show that content to more and more
people. Create content no one cares about and Facebook will make it as difficult as possible for you
put more of it out on its site.
Sponsored stories is a superior ad platform because it rewards nimbleness and quick reaction.
When it shows us that a piece of content is resonating, we know to spend money on it. It’s so clear.
When I think of what I could have done with a service like this back when I was in email marketing, I
could just cry for the amount of wine that we could have sold. Let’s say that on average about 20
percent of the people who received my emails back then actually opened them, and one day I sent out
an email that saw a 21 percent open rate. Then I saw that the wine mentioned in that email was
suddenly selling extremely well. Clearly something about that email had made it extra valuable to my
audience. How much would that knowledge have been worth? I would have happily paid Yahoo,
Gmail, and Hotmail a premium to make sure that the next time I sent out that email, as many people as
possible saw it, whether it was by working around spam filters or finding a way for the emails to
automatically open when people went to their email accounts. A service like that would have been the
greatest marketing tool in the world—heck, are you listening, Google?—and it’s close to what you
can achieve through Facebook sponsored stories.
Facebook is shockingly bad at explaining sponsored stories, so let me try here. There are two
types. One simply extends your chosen piece of content to the news streams of a larger number of
your fans than the regular 3–5 percent that would normally see it. That’s called a Page Post. The other
extends your reach the same way, but it allows you to highlight the fact that a fan has engaged with
your content and tell that fan’s friends about it. You can choose to create this kind of sponsored story
around a check-in, a like, and several other actions such as when someone shares a story from your
app or your website. For example, if a fan checked in to a hotel, or claimed an offer from a T-shirt
company, the hotel or T-shirt company could pay to make sure that friends of that fan knew about it,
not with an ad lingering on the periphery of the Facebook page that no one but PC users will see, but
within the actual newsfeed. That’s the big breakthrough for marketers. Before, when we created ads
around a post, as soon as it migrated to the right side of the page the format of the post would change.
This transformation compromised the impact of the creative work because it no longer looked like an
organic piece of content created by someone you knew, but like an ad created by some stranger. But
now marketers can keep the creative that we already know works organically, and enhance its power
simply by paying to have more people see it, offering us an unparalleled opportunity to connect with
active fans as well as reinvigorate relationships with fans that might have gone dormant over time.Sponsored stories work like this: When I sponsor the story, a higher number of people than
normally follow my page will see it in their News Feed. Now they are reminded about me. If the
content is actually good enough to compel them to act on that piece of content—liking, sharing, or
commenting on it—they get brought back into my orbit, and Facebook believes I am relevant once
again: “Facebook users like GaryVee, so I’m going to give them more GaryVee.” Now the next time I
post a new piece of content, many more of those people will be likely to see it. Yet I won’t have had
to pay any additional money to get those impressions. And if the engagement continues, my initial
costs will continue to diminish as my impressions rise. It could trigger a snowball effect that could
last well into the next month, and all for the price of one small sponsored story.
It’s important to realize that when you sponsor a story, you don’t buy additional data. What you get
is extended reach and an additional layer of targeting above and beyond that of an ordinary post or
targeted post, both of which are free. Put money behind a well-performing targeted post and turn it
into a sponsored story, and you’ll increase the specificity with which you can target your audience.
You could target a post for women, but your sponsored story can target women who enjoy arts and
crafts, and women who listen to country music. If you find out you’ve got a large swath of consumers
in your base who love dubstep, you might want to reference Skrillex in your content and send it their
way. If you’ve created a piece of content with a hip-hop theme, you can check to see which of your
fans consistently listens to A$AP Rocky and other hip-hop artists, and only send your content to them.
Knowing this kind of detail and using it to tailor content to match your fans’ tastes allows you to
create pulverizing right hooks.
GREAT BANG FOR YOUR BUCK
The sponsored story is one of the great ad opportunities of all time because it won’t let you spend
more than your content is worth. Facebook calculates the initial value of your sponsored story based
on the competition you face for your targeted audience, and how much that competition is willing to
pay. From there, you then tell Facebook how much you’re willing to pay for each click or impression
you want. But you won’t necessarily pay that amount. If you create a great ad that compels people toengage with you, Facebook will decide that your ad deserves priority over a competitor’s ad that
isn’t as engaging. Facebook will let you buy your impressions for cheaper than your competitors if it
sees that your ads are performing well, that people like them and are acting on them. In addition,
when Facebook sees that people are interacting with your content, it will show that content to more
people, because it is obviously enhancing the quality and entertainment value of the News Feed. The
second people stop clicking, though, Facebook will stop running the ad as a sponsored story. It will
still be visible to a core group of people, but it will be allowed to die a natural death, fading into
irrelevance. Unless, of course, you insist on throwing more money behind it. But why would you?
This time around, the sponsored story will cost you a lot more, and the results will be the same.
Essentially, Facebook purposely makes it cost-inefficient to distribute bad creative.
How cool is that? If you make a stupid television commercial, the network is going to run it as
many times as you pay it to. No billboard owner is going to look at your art and say, “Dude, I can’t
take your money. You won’t get a dime of business with that.” But Facebook will, not because it’s
nice enough to protect you from yourself, but because it’s savvy enough to protect itself from you. It’s
in Facebook’s best interest for you to put out great content. It wants to monetize, but if users start
feeling like they’re being spammed every time they go to the site, Facebook will suffer.
If networks could show marketers data that proved that every time they showed the consumer a
bad commercial, consumers turned off their TV, TV commercials would be better. That’s what
Facebook, and all social media, can do for us. Ideally, when Facebook informs you that no one is
interacting with your sponsored story, that’s your cue to stop and rework the piece, or chuck it
altogether. Facebook can’t tell you why it’s not working—you have to use the data it gives you to
figure that out for yourself. Social media gives us real-time feedback from the consumer, which forces
us to be better marketers, strategists, and service providers.
And it’s still ridiculously cheap. Maybe not as cheap as it used to be, but still a hell of a lot
cheaper than a TV ad. And find a television network, radio station, newspaper, magazine, or banner
ad provider that lets you test-drive your content for free in the form of organic or targeted posts the
way Facebook does.
Ultimately, the changes implemented to Facebook ads only changed how much it costs you to work
with Facebook, not how you tell your story. If you’re a brand that understands how to jab in ways that
bring value to your customers—giving them a moment of levity with a cartoon, or a game to play, or
any other escapist content, which then primes them to be open to giving you business when you finally
ask with a right hook—you’ll win. If you’re not, you won’t. No matter what Facebook does,
ultimately, it’s the content that matters. You can sponsor crap, and it won’t do anything for your sales.
But you don’t ever have to sponsor crap. Your Facebook community provides you with an automatic
crap filter every time you send out your content for free. Your organic reach may only be 3–5 percent
or so, but if a large percent of that organic reach is engaging with your content, you know you’ve got
something good. That’s the piece you sponsor. If you put out content and it doesn’t get any attention,
you know you need to rework it or try something new. Facebook gives you a risk-free method to
ensure that you only invest in what’s going to improve your business.
Things could change in the future. It’s possible that the platform will decide to start using actual
purchases as indicators of fan interest more than the engagement of comments, likes, or shares.
Obviously, making a purchase is a huge indicator that people want to see your content. That could
mean that Facebook becomes as much of a right hook platform as it is a jab platform. If that happens, Ipredict that Facebook will come up with a way to control right hooks as strictly as it does sponsored
stories. The last thing Facebook wants to become is a right hook platform, because it will die.
My advice to marketers is to quit complaining and start creating micro-content worth the money it
will take you to successfully reach the customers Facebook is now guarding so carefully. Get more
entrepreneurial. Figure out how to work the system and get the most bang for your buck. You can
afford to be innovative on Facebook in a way that you can’t on almost any other platform that exists.
Let’s see how. In the following pages, we’ll see some examples of perfect Facebook plays, as
well as some almost comical misses.
Please note, the critiques of the following case studies are my opinion only, based on years of
experience. I cannot claim any knowledge of any business’s agenda or original intent. I’m just
calling it as I see it.
COLOR COMMENTARY
AIR CANADA: Ruining a Good Idea
When Air Canada’s very first flight attendant, who worked for the airline from 1938 to 1943,
died at the age of 102, Air Canada paid her tribute by posting her photograph and a link to an
interview their in-flight magazine conducted with her about six months before her death. It
should have been a successful jab that engaged a large number of their 400,000 fans.
Unfortunately, they blew it.
Here’s why:
It’s not visually compelling.
It’s burdened with too much text.
It’s a link post when it should have been a picture post.It would have made all the difference had Air Canada just taken a little extra time to make
this post more visually compelling. Most of us would be thrilled to look as good at 102 as Mrs.
Lucile Garner Grant does in her head shot. Yet the two big blocks of text surrounding it water
down the impact of the photo. It’s too much to expect people to read all that when they’re
scrolling through their mobile devices at warp speed. By uploading the photograph as a picture
post instead of a link post, however, and overlaying the lines announcing Mrs. Garner Grant’s
death onto the picture itself, Air Canada could have emphasized the photo and simultaneously
explained why it was relevant. Next to the photo, they should have included nothing but the
subhead of the interview (and maybe a mention of the dogsled), along with a link to the article.
Like this:
That’s micro-content right there—compact, intriguing, of-the-moment, and native to the
platform. The layout is big and eye-catching enough to make a person scrolling through her
Facebook News Feed stop and say, “Damn, 102? Their very first flight attendant? What?” and
maybe click through to read the whole interview, which really does offer a fascinating glimpse
back in time and would be something many people would be compelled to share with friends.
Had Air Canada simply made a few small visual and textual adjustments, they would have had
more time to honor one of their employees, and also more time to tell a compelling story about
their brand.
JEEP: Evoking the Right Emotions
This picture perfectly encapsulates the Jeep brand. Jeep could not have chosen a better model
than the pretty young woman in this photo, with her shades, her flying hair, and her huge smileevoking summer, fun, and freedom. What’s cool is that she’s not a model—she’s someone a fan
named Megan Bryant photographed and posted on Facebook. The movement and mood of this
picture are striking enough to be worth checking out more closely. One look, and you start to
wish you had a Jeep, too.
The only thing that could slightly improve this piece would have been to make sure that the
copy, “It’s a Jeep Thing,” was more visible, perhaps by placing it onto the photo itself. With
that small adjustment, Jeep would have delivered a powerful image, its logo, and its terrific
tagline all in one shot. Otherwise, kudos to Jeep for such a beautiful, humanizing, and wellexecuted
jab.
MERCEDES-BENZ: A Great Product Deserved Better
Another car company took a more traditional route than Jeep by posting a photo of their
product. And what a product—that is one beautiful, luxurious car. The picture says it all, which
is why it’s too bad that Mercedes-Benz turned what should have been a solid jab, bordering on
a right hook, into a limp poke. Here’s how:
Too much text: It’s a shame Mercedes-Benz thought it needed to bog their stylish photo
down with a load of description that few people will to read. All they had to do was includeone line of text about the car’s sumptuous interior, and then link out to the excellent Forbes
article that told readers everything else they needed to know.
Poorly placed call to action: In addition, they placed their call to action—the link to the
article—at the bottom of that big paragraph of text. Why would they? Less text would have
highlighted the fact that Forbes wrote such a complimentary article instead of burying it.
No logo: As gorgeous as the car is, there’s no way to know who made it unless you think
to look at the post’s profile picture. It wouldn’t have sacrificed any class or sophistication
to make sure the Mercedes-Benz logo was tastefully inserted somewhere on the photo itself.
SUBARU: Amateur Night
There is so much to dislike about this piece of content it’s hard to know where to start.
Boring text: Like Mercedes-Benz, Subaru posted this piece to share a great review of
their new car. But whereas Mercedes-Benz talked too much, Subaru has said too little. The
copy length is ideal, but there was no reason to skip the opportunity to hint that the review
was a positive one. What’s the big secret? They’ve missed a chance to get the fans excited
and make them want to read more.
Terrible photo: Unless Subaru intended to sell pavement along with its cars, there is no
reason why a wet road should dominate the entire lower half of the photograph. The Subaru
is so far away it’s almost reduced to the same size as the little sailboats bobbing in the
background.No logo: There’s no reason for anyone to take notice of this photograph, but even if it did
somehow register, without a logo there is nothing to explain to people why this car deserves
attention.
While nothing could turn this pig’s ear into a silk purse, simply adding the Consumer
Reports headline, a logo, and cropping the photo differently might turn this wasted opportunity
into a serviceable jab.
VICTORIA’S SECRET: Fluent in the Platform’s Language
With this powerful right hook, Victoria’s Secret shows that they are fluent in native content–
ese:
Dramatic photo: Obviously it’s not just the wings this model is sporting that are going to
get people—men who love what she’s showing, and women who wish they had what she’s
showing—to screech to a halt in midscroll. But Victoria’s Secret made sure that the design
of the photo was as captivating as its subject. The image is big and bold enough to swallow
up both a PC screen and a mobile screen; the minimalist black-and-white adds drama; the
hot pink script overlaid against the model’s wings is as eye-popping as her cleavage and the
lingerie enhancing it. They did everything they could to make sure that no one could miss
this picture if it came into their News Feed.
Good use of copy: The text in the photo was placed close to the center, so that even if the
picture were cropped because of a small mobile screen, the text would remain visible. The
voice of the status update is pitch perfect, as is the length. The copy is short and direct, butthat line in parentheses delivers it with a little wink, which adds the dollop of personality
and humor that is so necessary to any brand’s social efforts.
Appropriate links: After the words “Apply here,” Victoria’s Secret attaches a link that
takes you directly to the page where you can register for an Angel Card, making it easy and
fast to make the sale. Is such a self-evident move really worth praise? You’d be amazed at
how many brands set up a beautiful right hook, and then link to their general website,
leaving customers fumbling around as they hunt for the appropriate tab so they can make
their purchase. For an example, see the Lacoste tweet on page 96.
MINI COOPER: Inspiring a Spirit of Adventure
Great voice: I love the voice in this piece. In two lines, the status update promises that if
you stick with Mini, you’ll find adventure. You could be in Switzerland! Driving through the
snow! In a convertible! The idea of driving with the top down through snow is so absurd,
it’s almost impossible to resist clicking on the attached link to find out how Mini could actlike this drive was the trip of a lifetime. And the line “Wrap up warm” adds to our curiosity
by hinting that whatever lies behind that link will put to rest any doubts we might have as to
how comfortable the experience could be. Once you go to the blog post, which documents
how all it takes is a pair of snow goggles and Mini’s heated leather seats to make an openair
alpine drive as comfortable as a road trip down California’s Highway 1, you’re sold.
Lacks a logo: I’ll forgive Mini for neglecting to include a logo on the photograph it used
for this Facebook piece because the Mini is an iconic car, recognizable even when
photographed from the back, as in this image. Still, I hope someone at the company reads
this book and picks up the tip about including the logo on your micro-content, because if they
start doing that their jabs will leave little to criticize.
Well played, Mini.
ZARA: Bait and Switch
With 19 million fans, Zara is a Facebook powerhouse. Why it chose to fail those fans so badly
with this useless post is incomprehensible. Let’s dissect why it is a complete waste of the
brand’s and its fans’ time.
Poor mobile optimization: I had to literally squint to read the fine print underneath the
headline accompanying the photos. And what the hell are those two little squiggles under the
iPhone? It’s even hard to make out that that yellow square is a sticky-note pad without
bending your face closer to your screen. And that’s when the post is viewed on a laptop!
The image would have been almost impossible to see on a mobile device.
Good copy: At least they got the copy right. “Just Apps” is short and sweet and tells you
everything you need to know, which is that Zara has apps. Great. Where do I get me some?
Ah, a link! I’m going to click on it. Now I can . . . shop on the Zara official home page. But I
wanted to download an app! Isn’t that what you just announced, your apps? What the hell,
Zara?The more a brand posts links to sites that don’t bring value to their customers, the more
hesitant fans are going to be to click any links they see from that brand in the future. This
Facebook post is a short-term fail for letting its fans down with a bait-and-switch post, and a
potentially long-term fail for jeopardizing the respect and equity Zara has earned within its
community.
REGAL CINEMAS: Leveraging Their Brand
No industry has a better stable of iconic images with which to leverage their brand than the
film industry. Yet not long ago I was analyzing a lot of movie theaters’ Facebook pages because
I was considering some social media marketing opportunities, and at the time it was almost
impossible to find a movie theater that used their status updates for anything other than pushing
ticket purchases on Fandango. Regal Cinemas, however, bucked the trend with this successful
jab that pits two movie characters against each other.
The picture: The theater’s marketing creatives probably sifted through thousands of
pictures of each of these movie characters before deciding which ones to use, and they
chose well. Even though Thornton Melon and Frank the Tank went back to school in films
made almost twenty years apart, they’re clearly steeped in the same frat DNA.
The copy: For once, the status update for this content doesn’t repeat the copy in the
artwork. Instead, the headline of the picture sets up the question, and the status update
reminds us of the characters’ names, just in case someone out there isn’t familiar with them.
And yet, at the risk of repeating itself, the company could have seen even better engagement
had they listed the names of each character under their photo, or at worst simply labeled
them “A” or “B.” Rule of thumb: Make it as easy as possible for your fans to engage! Why
take the risk that someone won’t be able to come up with the characters’ names right awayand therefore lose the opportunity to engage with them?
Yet again, no logo: Good for Regal Cinemas for remembering to build brand equity, but
they would have been better off using a logo than a banner across the bottom of the art. Few
people are going to type out the movie theater’s URL, so a better use of their limited space
would have been to include a sizable logo in the corner. But that’s a minor criticism.
Very on point, Regal Cinemas. I’m happy with you.
PHILIPPINE AIRLINES: Totally Unappetizing
People love to talk about food, so Philippine Airlines, which flies to lots of exotic
destinations, had a good idea when it decided to ask its fans to describe their most exotic meal.
But after having such a good idea, why did the company waste it?
Poor use of the platform: It should go without saying that if you’re going to talk about
food, and you have the option to post a photograph, you should post the damn photograph.
Philippine Airlines could have posted a gorgeous photo of a sublime Asian dish, or
approached the concept with humor by photographing a plate of testicles or some other
exotic dish—to Western palates, anyway—on an airline tray. It would have taken little
effort to turn this content into something beautiful or fun.
Toneless: With airplane food the butt of so many jokes, they couldn’t come up with a way
to imply that Philippine Airlines knows a little bit about great food? This status update is so
bland and vacuous, any company in the world could have posted it. The company simply
made no attempt to make the question relevant to Philippine Airlines or its customers.
Too many call-to-actions: Finally, Philippine Airlines needs to remember that less is
more. Doubling the number of calls to action made it more challenging to get people to
answer the questions. It seems crazy, but when people are moving through the stream as fast
as they do now, two questions are too much. They should have been listed as two separate
posts.SELENA GOMEZ: A Golden Touch
Your phone and your fingers are together all the time, so why shouldn’t they complement each
other? No wonder the hot new women’s fashion trend is to match your manicure to your phone
case. Here Selena Gomez laughs at herself for jumping on the fad in this savvy jab (the phone
and the manicure reflect the same warm gold as Selena’s promotional poster for her Stars
Dance world tour), all while proving that she can carry it off to literally dazzling effect.The photo: It’s big and bold, very native to the Facebook platform. With Selena’s glittery
hand and phone swallowing up the camera, the picture would have been unmissable as fans
scrolled through their news streams.
The copy: Celebrities are some of the worst social media abusers, and one of their
biggest offenses is that they usually talk too much. Selena doesn’t, and with this status update
she was smart enough to keep her text short and playful.
Shared more than 6,000 times and earning more than 220,000 likes, this sponsored story
with Selena Gomez shows how far fans are willing to carry a brand’s content when you make
them feel like everything you do is just for them.
SHAKIRA: Falling Flat
Shakira rolls deep with 63 million fans, and with this post does each and every one of them, as
well as herself, a disservice.
Wrong type of post: Remember how Selena’s photo exploded into your line of vision?
This one you have to squint to see, because it’s a link post, not a photo post. When you
attach YouTube links, the fill-out—the headline, link, and text—share as much space as the
photo, minimizing the photo’s effectiveness.
Poor photo: Not that this photo would have been particularly effective had it been any
larger. The point of the post is to promote Shakira’s new perfume. So why are we seeing an
image of her posing with a fan and a signed soccer jersey at a podium? It’s great to show
how comfortable and generous Shakira is with her fans, but this is the wrong image for the
purpose of this content.
The copy: First there’s the copy in English. Then there’s the copy in Spanish. And then
there’s the description in the YouTube fill-out. This isn’t a novel, it’s a status update, and
it’s supposed to be short. Brands have always been able to post according to language and
location, so there was no need to double up on languages in this post. Especially when thecontent is so uninspiring. It’s strange that a woman with such a sizzling hot brand would post
text with so little pizzazz.
No engagement: In addition, with the exception of one shout-out to her fans to thank them
for liking her new Facebook page, there’s no engagement between the star and her fans. That
seems like a strange choice for someone who wants people to buy her perfume.
The video: It’s six minutes long. No one in a Facebook mobile world has time to watch a
six-minute video about your new perfume, no matter how much we like you.
The whole package, if you can stand to sit through the entire length of it, is supposed to give
us a peek into the whirlwind life of a star, while revealing her humanity. There are many ways
that Shakira’s team could have accomplished this while bringing value to her fans.
LIL WAYNE: Welcome to Spam City, USA
There is no other way to start this review than to congratulate Lil Wayne for becoming the first
person to successfully turn Facebook into Myspace.
Poor page management: Allowing people to use your fan page to build up their own
businesses and Facebook pages is an insult to all the core fans who come here to be a part
of your community. In addition, you risk turning those fans into antifans, as evidenced by the
comments speaking up in irritation “Ok, Lil Wayne, we get it, you posted this eight times.
. . .” That individual is in for a long wait if he’s hoping for a direct reply, though—Weezy
doesn’t come here. Ever. His neglect in managing his page, cleaning out the spam, and
engaging with people implies that he really doesn’t care about his fans, and creates little
reason for his fans to care in return, or to come back to his Facebook page.
It’s tough for me to make fun of Weezy because I love his music, but honestly, when you put
this little effort into your social media promotion, you’re no better than the amateurs sticking
promo fliers under people’s windshield wipers.MOSCOT: Possibly the Most Confusing Facebook Post Ever
Normally, this small American business puts in a solid performance on Facebook, but this
post, highlighting a positive review of the brand on an Israeli website, reveals a number of key
mistakes.
Text, text, and more problems with text: First, there’s the double copy supporting the
photograph of Johnny Depp, in Hebrew and in English (though it takes some effort to find the
English text). Facebook is not the place to be flooding fans with text.
Indecipherable text: Second, the copy that does hit us in the face is in Hebrew. It’s kind
of arresting, and when combined with the photo of Johnny Depp may be enough to make
readers stop in their tracks. But not for long. As soon as most fans realize that they can’t
read anything on the page—this is an American company, and most fans will be American—
they’re going to move on. Few will hunt beneath the brand’s tiny profile picture and click on
“See More,” where they will be rewarded with the English translation of the article. Last,
whether in Hebrew or in English, no one should ever post copy more than a thousand words
long on Facebook.
One more thing. Here and all over their Facebook page, Moscot likes its own posts. That’s
lamezor, Moscot. Please stop.UNICEF: Giving Away Too Much, Too Soon
This celebrity-based post is another example of how ignoring the small nuances of a platform
can make or break your content.
Good imagery: UNICEF did a lot right here. They had their finger on the pop culture
pulse and chose the right celebrity with the ever-popular Katy Perry. The picture of a
smiling Katy jumping rope with some village girls in her UNICEF T-shirt is spot-on, and
should work well to bring awareness to the brand.
Botched copy: Where they goofed is in the copy. The first line is “Want to know what
Katy Perry has been up to?” Good question. Provocative. Engaging. And UNICEF blew it
by offering the answer.
The post should have ended with that first line, punctuated with a link. Leaving the question
hanging would have whetted visitors’ appetites for more, and kept them intrigued enough to
follow UNICEF’s digital bread crumbs to their website, where they could have elaborated on
their humanitarian work in Madagascar and other countries. Serving up the answer right away
robbed the post of all its energy and style.
It’s a near miss—just one little tweak and this jab would have hit its mark.LAND ROVER: Going Nowhere
I wanted to destroy this Land Rover post the first time I saw it, but as I looked under the hood, I
started to wonder whether the problems plaguing this content were caused by a lack of
corporate support for a creative team’s honest efforts.No brand ID: Don’t get me wrong, the execution is weird. Imagine this coming through
your stream. You see a woman peering through a telescope at you, but with no logo and no
prominently overlaid text, there’s no way to know what it’s about unless you pause to squint
at the text below.
Wrong URL: There, we see the post is from Land Rover, and that they’ve got something
special planned and they’d like us to send in a passport-style photo to
landroversocialmedia@gmail.com. They did a good job of keeping the text short and to the
point, but then they made a surprisingly ghetto choice. Why didn’t Land Rover secure a
.landrover email address instead of a Gmail address? In addition, one can only hope that
they aren’t strict with their definition of “passport-style,” because the photo they used, with
half the woman’s head blocked by a telescope, is not passport-style. Maybe that doesn’t
matter, though, because when we click through the link that takes us to a page where we can
read more about the project, they don’t reiterate the passport-style requirement.
Go-nowhere link: This error in consistency is minor, however, compared with the fact
that the link takes us from the company’s Facebook post . . . straight to another company
Facebook post. This tells me that the creative team wasn’t given the proper financial or
managerial support to execute this project correctly with a proper website.
Showing off scrappy entrepreneurial spirit and making do with the resources you’ve got is
admirable for a start-up, but not for a company like Land Rover, which sells a fairly expensive
product.STEVE NASH: A Disappointing Departure
It is entirely possible that this post was chosen for no other reason than that my dear friend
Nate is a bitter Steve Nash hater for leaving his beloved Phoenix Suns, and I was only too
happy to have an excuse to give Nash a negative review. That said, objectively speaking, this is
one horrible piece of content.
Until now, Nash has cultivated a solid social media presence that respects the platforms and
engages his fans. This piece is such a departure that it makes me wonder if he might have been
surrounded by some strong social media advisers back in Phoenix, and then lost them when he
moved to Los Angeles. The post was meant to promote the Steve Nash Foundation Showdown,
a charity soccer match featuring NBA stars going against top futbol players from around the
world.
Nonnative design: Anyone who visited Nash’s fan page directly was invited to the Steve
Nash Foundation “HOWDOW.” If they consumed this on their phone they saw it as an
“OWDOW.” You’ve got to be smart about your status update art, and someone on Nash’s
media team was not.Broken link: The URL attached to the update doesn’t link out, which means Nash is
counting on fans cutting and pasting the link into their URL if they want to go to the
Showdown website. I assure you all of zero people did that, which is too bad because it’s a
beautiful website, not to mention an extremely cool and worthy cause.
No spam control: Finally, here we go again with the spam. The comment thread is littered
with it. There’s a plague of people who use popular fan pages to promote themselves or
their businesses, and the managers of these pages need to do a better job of weeding them
out.
All of these mistakes can only be a result of carelessness or laziness. Nash fans deserve

AMTRAK: Using Sawdust to Its Advantage
Iride Amtrak all the time, and this Facebook post made me glad that I do. I love this post—it’s
one of the best jabs I’ve seen in a long time. Best of all, it allows me to dispel some confusion
about what social media can and cannot do.
Great use of sawdust: You’ve got to be damn smart to figure out how to take an image of
something quite boring, even forgettable, like two train seats, and turn it into a fun,
energizing piece of content. I call material like those train seats “sawdust”—assets that you
have just lying around, maybe something you totally take for granted.
Gamification: Not only did Amtrak take advantage of their sawdust, they gamified it. Tag
who you’d like to travel with—that’s a fun, clever challenge that strikes an emotional punch
(although it’s a fairly big ask that could give you unreliable results). And what a great way
to take advantage of the platform. Every person who receives a notification that they’ve
been tagged will immediately register the Amtrak brand. It’s a great way to build awarenesseven among people who may not already be fans.
Authenticity: There’s a real person behind this post, too. You can tell because when one
fan suggested Justin Bieber as his preferred seatmate, Amtrak replied with “But where
would Selena Gomez go?” With one sentence, Amtrak reveals that its employees are our
contemporaries, people just like us, with their fingers on the pop culture pulse, a sense of
humor, and a real interest in their customers.
The only criticism worth lobbing at Amtrak is that they chose a picture of some pretty wornout
seats. The last time these seats saw some fresh upholstery was probably in 1964, when they
were probably made. This brings me to the misconception a lot of marketers have about social
media. It’s not lipstick. No matter how brilliant, clever, or authentic you are, nothing will cover
up the flaws in your content. Some people will appreciate the retro look of the seats, but a lot of
people won’t find them very appealing. Amtrak would have been wise to choose some less
worn-out seats, or cleaned these up a little better before posting a picture of them. This poor
sense of aesthetic is the only detail marring what is otherwise a perfectly executed jab.
BLACKBERRY: Missed Details Matter
My team and I struggled for several minutes to understand the story behind this post. We liked
a lot about it, but then we realized that if it was that challenging to figure out what BlackBerry
was trying to say, the story couldn’t have registered much with an audience that probably spent
less than a second thinking about it.
Poor storytelling technique: I understand the story that BlackBerry was trying to tell—
the BlackBerry Z10 is two phones in one—one for work, one for play. And if you click on
the link below the picture, you’re taken to a pretty cool YouTube video that illustrates
exactly what’s special about the phone. In addition, you’ll find another link that takes you to
the product’s retail site. But though the brand correctly chose to make its photo the star of
the update, the image does not do enough of the storytelling for us. Why not show someone
attending a kid’s soccer game juxtaposed with a shot of that same person at the office? You
have to look extremely closely to recognize the difference between the two screens. In
addition, the text talks about work-life harmony, but the screens are reversed, in life-work
order. That’s sloppy. And finally, people live their whole lives looking at screens—now
they have to look at screens on their screens? It’s a little meta for a mobile device company.BlackBerry was right to make a big push for this product and tell their story in social, but
they should have paid more attention to the details of their execution.
MICROSOFT: Riding the Waves
It’s nice to see a stodgy, unsexy company show its creative, fun side as it rides the zeitgeist.
Good use of links: In this exciting jab, Microsoft is promoting a product called Fresh
Paint, an app that allows you to use a palette of colors to “paint” in templates or even on
your own pictures and photographs. Fans can read all about it in the blog Microsoft posted
two months before this status update, easily accessible via the link beneath the picture of
Dory and Nemo. It tells us how Microsoft partnered with Disney-Pixar to create a Fresh
Paint “Finding Nemo pack,” a collection of original coloring pages and their appropriate
palette of colors. They wisely took advantage of the announcement that there would be a
sequel to Finding Nemo to showcase their product.
Offers quality, value, and authenticity: The post shows that the creative team atMicrosoft is doing some smart thinking about where the cultural conversation is going, and
how they can find ways to be a part of it. The brand receives more high marks for the quality
of the image, the fact that the voice of the text isn’t too corporate, and the way they brought
something of value to their community. In this status update and on the blog, Microsoft really
does sound excited about both the movie and their product. If only more companies would
use Facebook this well.
ZEITGEIST: Missing Its Inner Hipster
This post is stunningly bad. Hipsters have told me that Zeitgeist is the ultimate hipster bar in
San Francisco. Ironically, everything that’s wrong with this jab could have been easily avoided
if someone with a modicum of stereotypically hipster skills had created the post.
Low Facebook value: First, the post in and of itself has zero value but to divert fans to
Twitter. There’s no copy, just a mess of hashtags. Hashtags have infiltrated our culture so
much that people are starting to use them as an ironic coda to status updates and even regular
conversations. They have long been a huge part of Twitter and Instagram’s appeal, where
they overindex, and recently Facebook introduced them to the platform as well. It’s possible
that Zeitgeist was trying to incorporate hashtags into their voice, but they don’t work here.
Incorrect post format: Next, it’s a link post, and at the time this post was created, link
posts underperformed compared with picture posts that link out (though that could change in
the future). In this case, though, a picture post wouldn’t have saved the status update. It might
have even made it worse.
Sorry photography: The link takes us to a Twitter account where we see that Zeitgeist
tweeted out a picture of what must be a Russian River Brewing beer tasting, showing a
group of people sitting around a flight of beers. But the picture is so dark and blurry you
really have to work to see what it is. That defies reason. Zeitgeist is a hip brand whose
demo is all about modern technology. Photography has become a kind of social currency.
This is not a great photo. It’s not even good. It’s the kind of picture you delete and take
again. By allowing this subpar art to get posted, Zeitgeist implies that it’s actually not very
good at tech, and not as hip and cool as its customers. It’s the kind of subliminal message
that can kill a company.TARTINE BAKERY: One Hot Mess
Tartine Bakery, a hugely popular café and pastry shop in San Francisco, has published two
gorgeous illustrated cookbooks that received national attention and praise. Their Facebook
post, however, indicates that like many entrepreneurs, businesses, and Fortune 500 companies,
they are willing to invest energy, effort, and dollars into familiar platforms, but they have yet to
put that same creative and strategic energy into the contemporary platforms where their fans
actually spend more of their time. This post has so much wrong with it I have to edit my
comments for the sake of space.
Unclear messaging: This post on the Tartine Bakery fan page is actually promoting an
event at the bakery’s sister restaurant, Bar Tartine. It’s fine to cross-promote among
communities, but they should have made it explicitly clear that this isn’t a bakery event,
since most fans are coming to this fan page looking for bakery news.
Awkward text: They write: “Bar Tartine (with Link!) hosts . . .” What an awkward,
poorly written phrase. Plus, it shows that someone at Tartine actually believes that fans are
too stupid to know what that little blue URL is for at the end of the post.
Irrelevant hashtag: What’s up with the hashtag? The post doesn’t direct us to Twitter, so
what purpose does it serve here?
No photo: This is as visually unfriendly as it gets. Tartine is promoting a food-centered
charitable event, and they couldn’t whet our appetites with a little teaser of food porn or
some other cool image to get us excited about it?
The fourth error might explain mistake number three. Not only did Tartine not include an
image to accompany its charitable event, but it looks like they actually deleted one. When you
attach a URLto a status update, a thumbnail image automatically appears beneath your post. But
there is none here. The only way that can happen is if someone chose not to include an image. If
you type the URL into your browser and head over to the fund-raising event’s page, you might
see why. There you’ll find the most god-awful picture of a deconstructed burger ever drawn.
The lettuce is vaguely dinosaur-shaped and fluorescent green; the meat, which actually looks
like strips of radicchio glued together, glows red from the inside like some kind of nuclear
accident about to happen, topped with fluorescent green caterpillars that are probably supposed
to be pickles. It is a nightmare. No wonder Tartine Bakery didn’t want that thing showing up onits fan page. Which then raises the question, why didn’t they step in and provide better art to the
organization that created the fund-raising Web page?
Insufficient page management: Finally, back on the fan page, the four spam comments—
the only comments anyone bothered to make—are the cherries on top of this crap sundae.
TWIX: Having Fun
Twix threw a good jab here. They left their logo off the photograph, which is too bad, because
as I have repeatedly pointed out, these images go through consumers’ mobile streams so quickly
it’s easy for them to see a picture but not register who posted it. That said, Twix is such an
iconic candy bar that most people will probably recognize what they’re seeing right away, so in
this case the omission isn’t that big a deal.
Clever storytelling, strong voice, good use of pop culture: In the past, Twix has run
television ads that played on the crisp sound of a Twix snapping in two, and in this post
they’re reinforcing that story by playing off the well-known “tree in the forest”
philosophical riddle. It’s a cute idea. The text shows that the writer has a strong feel for the
brand’s quirky, playful voice. The nice level of engagement the post received proves how
appealing it is to customers when a brand skillfully inserts itself into the pop culture
conversation to tell its story. They should be primed to respond whenever Twix gets ready
to throw a right hook down the line.
COLGATE: Good Copy Gone BadCatchy text: “Did You Know?” in all caps works for me. Maybe I like the copy in this
Colgate post because I grew up an ESPN SportsCenter fan. Regardless, this is an
appropriately short, tight, positive reinforcement of the brand’s interest in being important to
a community that values a healthy, wholesome lifestyle. Unfortunately, the excellent text is
attached to a picture that screams stock photo. Its generic personality zaps away any brand
reinforcement the company could have engendered with its strong setup. Interestingly, the
post did receive some strong engagement. I credit the good copy. The brand could have seen
even more response had it just overlaid the Colgate logo and the text directly onto the
picture. That might have even gone viral. As it stands, though, this post is a yawn.
KIT KAT: Timed Out
This is as good as a status update gets, except for one teeny, tiny mistake that makes a huge
difference in the reach and influence of any post.
Art, tone, logo, text—it’s all good: Posted the Friday before the 2013 Super Bowl
Sunday, the art in Kit Kat’s status update is fun and creative, and with pitch-perfect tone the
picture and art lend an entertaining voice to the global conversation. In the right-handcorner, they included their slogan, which is an excellent alternative to a company logo.
More brands should use their slogan and consistently incorporate it into their social media
efforts. The product is prominent and cleverly used; the text, the tagline, and the brand
slogan echo each other; the cultural reference is universal. The only misstep is in the timing
of the post.
Thoughtless timing: The Super Bowl in 2013 featured the Baltimore Ravens and the San
Francisco 49ers. Kit Kat launched this post at 6 A.M. Eastern Standard Time. In general, a 6
A.M. post is going to underindex because it only hits the early risers. Now, there were
probably plenty of Ravens fans checking Facebook as they muddled through their earlymorning
routines, so it surely wasn’t a complete loss. But what about the 49ers fans in San
Francisco? It was 3 A.M. in their time zone when this post went live. Three o’clock in the
morning has to be the single worst time you could post anything on social media. Even the
people working two jobs to make ends meet are sleeping at 3 A.M. Hell, I’m sleeping at 3
A.M. (when my infant son lets me). No one on the West Coast was watching when Kit Kat
posted this status update. This is a great example of how a brand’s poor understanding of the
psychology and behaviors of social media users can weaken their best efforts. In this case,
it’s a real shame, because Kit Kat’s performance is so strong in this arena, other companies
should be modeling their jabs after it.
LUKE’S LOBSTER: Logoless
I love this place. Only my wife, Lizzie, knows how much—we once ate here four days in a
row. On this post, Luke’s Lobster did a nice job on their copy. But since the company’s
timeline is filled with pictures of lobster rolls pretty much 365 days a week, it would have been
a nice twist to show some mother flair on their Mother’s Day post. That’s the missed
opportunity.
The real problem, though, is that it would be easy for the speedy and casual observer tothink that Cape Cod Potato Chips put out this post. Lots of brands post Facebook and Instagram
shots that incorporate products from companies other than their own, and that’s fine—so long as
you have prominently branded your photo with your company logo in a highly noticeable
corner. Which you really should do. Every time.
DONORS CHOOSE: A Solid Try
Many nonprofits litter the social media universe with such spammy content they make the likes
of Lil Wayne look good (see page 59). This piece of content doesn’t have the branding elements
or many of the important details I’ve demanded from other businesses, but so few nonprofits do
anything on Facebook but throw right hooks asking for money or inviting people to fund-raising
galas that I wanted to give some love to Donors Choose for throwing this jab. In fact, they
generally post a lot of status updates that show they’re committed to jabs. I know nothing about
this NGO or how it is run, but this quote seems thematically appropriate and tied to their
mission. Sure, it’s generic, but who knows, maybe they’ll read this book and learn how to take
their content up a notch. While they’re at it, they can put some additional effort into their
community management, which is currently almost nonexistent. If there’s any place where
people need to feel a strong sense of humanity, it’s from the nonprofit world.INSTAGRAM: A Textbook Case, and Not in a Good Way
As you’d expect, Instagram’s Facebook page is filled with stunning visuals, and this one
accompanying a list of Instagrammers exhibiting their work at the Venice Biennale is gorgeous.
The announcement itself, though, shows that when Facebook bought Instagram, they didn’t give
their new employees a tutorial on how to properly storytell on their own platform. How could a
subsidiary of Facebook post such copy-heavy images? There’s not even a punch line or pitch.
Instagram may as well have thrown up a textbook on their timeline for all the excitement that
post inspires.CONE PALACE: Yum
I need to thank Cone Palace for giving me a chance to offer an in-depth commentary at what
spot-on micro-content strategy looks like. Cone Palace is an institution in Kokomo, Indiana. I
can’t speak about the food from experience, but if its owners pay as much attention to the
quality and taste of their food as they do to their Facebook marketing strategy, it’s no doubt a
good reason why they’ve stayed in business since 1966.
Cone Palace earned about two thousand fans as soon as they launched their Facebook page
by promoting a big event and offering a 10 percent discount. But though people joined to
become part of the community, they probably stayed because of the good content. Their
standards are high and exacting. Before posting anything, they ask themselves, “If I saw this
picture, would I share it?” If the answer is no, they don’t post. That’s an example many
marketers should follow. Don’t expect your consumers’ expectations and standards to be any
lower than your own.Their posts aren’t complicated, and they only put out two kinds—photographs of their food,
and text posts announcing specials and new menu items, or that use local events (including
people’s birthdays), the weather, and holidays to provide context for their business. Hard-core
analytical types might not trust Cone Palace’s sometimes anecdotal, unscientific methods for
measuring ROI, but when they post a picture of a hamburger and fries, and fans post comments
that they’re drooling and coming in for lunch, it seems safe to say that the content effectively
increases sales.
And what content! Originally, staff took iPhone pictures of the food. But then they noticed
that on the occasion when they had a particularly great quality photo, their engagements and
interactions shot up. So they invested in a professional photographer who takes all of their food
shots.
I would never have had the audacity to recommend to every business, especially a small
mom-and-pop shop, that they should hire a professional photographer to take pictures of their
product for social media content, because of the tremendous overhead it would represent, but
secretly that’s exactly what I wish every business would do. And you know, if you’ve got the
will, there is always a way. Ever heard of bartering? That’s an idea we need to take more
seriously. When I think back, I could have bartered wine in exchange for professional shots ofwine labels in a heartbeat if I had wanted to. If you’re a small business—a shoe salesperson, a
lawyer, an electrician, or maybe a real estate agent—you can provide a service or product in
exchange for another service or product that you need, like professional photographs. It would
be such a worthwhile investment. A beautiful photo of your product makes all the difference in
the world. Flip ahead to the picture of the apple turnover on Arby’s Pinterest board on page
128—would you rather eat there, or at Cone Palace?
There is one thing Cone Palace could have done better: When that generic photo of a banana
split whizzed through people’s newsfeed, it would have been smart for consumers to see a
Cone Palace logo in the bottom of the picture or at the top left. Have I beaten that horse to death
yet? INCLUDE YOUR LOGO IN YOUR PICTURE!
Kudos to a business that has figured out how to innovate and evolve for a half century, and
shows no signs of stopping.
REGGIE BUSH: Being Human
Let it be said straight up that if Reggie Bush were still playing for the Dolphins, instead of the
Lions, there’s no way he would have made it into this book. I hate the Dolphins. But now that
he’s a Lion, I can give him daps. He deserves them.
Every celebrity page should be infused with this much humanity and empathy. I love what
Reggie Bush has done with his Facebook timeline, offering a terrific mix of inspirational
quotes, family photos, shout-outs to people he admires (both celebrity and non), and personal
reflections and anecdotes. The way he tripled down on content allows him to come across as
extraordinarily human. This particular photo is not perfect—the glare covers up one of thenumbers. But he’s using it properly to engage with his community, making it a perfect jab that
will support any right hook he throws in the future.
A little Easter egg for any early readers of this book: Reggie Bush plays a Monday night
game on December 16, 2013. If you read this before then, please mark the game on your
calendar. After you watch, @reply me @garyvee with the hashtag #JJJRHreggiebush and give
me your thoughts on the content that Reggie has been posting on his Facebook page. I will
randomly pick three or four people who write to me and send them a replica of their favorite
player’s jersey.
Questions to Ask When Creating Facebook Micro-Content
Is the text too long?Is it provocative, entertaining, or surprising?
Is the photo striking and high-quality?
Is the logo visible?
Have we chosen the right format for the post?
Is the call to action in the right place?
Is this interesting in any way, to anyone? For real?
Are we asking too much of the person consuming the content?ROUND 4:LISTEN WELL on TWITTER
Launched: March 2006
As of December 2012, there were more than 100 million users in the United States, 500 million
worldwide.
The Twitter concept evolved out of a brainstorming session that took place at the top of a slide
on a San Francisco playground.
The company’s logo, a little blue bird, is officially named Larry, after Larry Bird, the former
player for the Boston Celtics.
JetBlue was one of the first companies to start using Twitter for marketing research and
customer service.
Users post 750 tweets per second.
Italk about Twitter with almost the same affection as I talk about my children. It’s had that
much of an impact on my life since I started using it to reach out to customers in 2007. As an
extrovert who can get to know a room full of people in just a few hours, I felt at home in
Twitter’s 140-word cocktail party environment. It was the platform that came most naturally to
me, because it was perfectly suited for small bursts of quick-fire conversation and idea
exchanges. If the only platform I’d had at my disposal in early 2006, when I first started trying
to storytell about my family business, Wine Library, had demanded long-form writing, like a
magazine column or a written blog, the business would not be what it is today. Twitter’s
restrictions played directly to my strengths. I owe it part of my career.
Yet discussing Twitter poses a problem for a book dedicated to improving social media content,
because on this platform, and this platform alone, content often has far less value than context. How
can I say that when Twitter is one of this generation’s primary sources for news and information?
Because with few exceptions, like the micro-content gold that is Grumpy Cat, a brand’s success on
Twitter is rarely predicated on the actual content it produces. Rather, it correlates with how much
valuable context you add to the content—your own, and that produced by others.
Before I explain, it’s necessary to acknowledge that at the time of this writing, there are changes
afoot at Twitter. Until now, thanks to its origins as a mobile text-messaging service, the beauty of
Twitter has been its simplicity—two or three lines of text, a link, and maybe a hashtag. But in late
2012, the company bought Vine, the six-second looping video service, and innovations such as
Twitter Cards now allow people to attach photos, videos, and music directly to their tweets, thus
incorporating the advantages of other more visually exciting platforms like Facebook and Pinterest.
These visual enhancements will pave the way for businesses to deliver content in ways that are fresh
and unique to Twitter. For example, you could tweet out a puzzle piece and announce that if one
thousand people retweet it, you’ll tweet another piece of the puzzle. Once all the pieces are tweeted,
the puzzle would reveal where people could go to get a twenty-five-dollar gift certificate. It will be
fun to explore new ways to creatively execute jabs and right hooks in such a mobile-friendly, colorful
medium.
But that’s all still in the works. And I’m not even sure the Facebookification of Twitter will makethat much difference to those brands that haven’t already gained traction there, because the additional
bells and whistles won’t force marketers to change how they actually use the platform. Hopefully this
chapter will, though.
The main mistake most marketers make is to use Twitter primarily as an extension of their blog, a
place to push a link to content they have posted elsewhere. They’ll also often use it as a place to brag,
especially by retweeting favorable things people say about them, a new form of humblebragging I call
a “birdiebrag.” There is a time and place for both of these types of right hooks, but not to the extent
that most companies rely on them. Twitter primarily rewards people who listen and give, not those
who ask and take. Much of the time, to read a Twitter feed is to read a mind-numbing number of right
hooks. Yet if there has ever been a platform where engagement and community management have
power, it’s this one. There’s a lot of talking and selling on Twitter, but not enough engagement, and
that’s a travesty, because Twitter is the cocktail party of the Internet—a place where listening well
has tremendous benefits.
SPIN YOUR STORY
If Facebook’s main currency is friendship, Twitter’s is news and information. Go on Twitter and
you’ll see eighty-five people and brands at one time announcing that Brangelina is pregnant again or
there’s been another tornado in Oklahoma. Anyone can present news, and on their own, your tweets
about your product or service are tiny drops in the deluge of information that hits people when they
come to the site. The only way to differentiate yourself and pique people’s interest is through your
unique context. Breaking out on Twitter isn’t about breaking the news or spreading information—it’s
about deejaying it. News has little value on its own, but the marketer who can skillfully spin,
interpret, and remix it in his or her own signature style can often tell a story that is more powerful and
memorable than the actual news itself.
For example, if you’re a movie theater in Minneapolis, you could tweet “Just in—a great review
of Bradley Cooper’s newest movie from the Star Tribune.” This is a common way to tweet—a little
content, a link to a website, and you’re done. But what if you put a little more than the bare minimum
of effort into that jab? What if instead of offering the boring facts, you offered something fresh? How
much more interesting would it be if you tweeted “The Star Tribune has lost its mind. This movie
stinks!” and then add the link. Now that jab has some muscle behind it. Is it possible that panning
something you sell will hurt sales? On Wine Library TV, I gave poor reviews to plenty of wines that
were on sale in my store, and all it did was give people more reason to trust me. But if you were that
worried about it, you could turn your negative review into a positive opportunity with a tweet like
“The Star Tribune loves the new Bradley Cooper thriller. We think this movie stinks. Read. Watch.
Debate.” You’d then link to your blog, where you would not only have a copy of the review, but
information on where and when your movie club meets every month. That’s a terrific right hook.
You’ve now positioned yourself as the opinionated, provocative movie theater that offers a unique
film-watching experience, and that’s a story that people will be interested in following.
Today, entertainment and escapism are prized above almost anything else. Consumers want
infotainment, not information. Information is cheap and plentiful; information wrapped in a story,
however, is special. Brands need to storytell around their content to make it enticing, not just put itout for passive consumption like a boring platter of cubed cheese.
EXPAND YOUR UNIVERSE
Make a statement, stake out a position, establish a voice—this is how you successfully jab your
Twitter followers. But what about all those people who have never heard of you? How are you
jabbing them?
Other than the easy mobile experience it offers, Twitter stands in a class apart from other social
media because of the open invitation it gives us to talk to the world at large. On Facebook, Tumblr, or
Instagram, you have only two options if you want to meet new fans and potential customers. First,
someone might find you offline through a class, a book, an ad, or a brick-and-mortar store, and decide
to follow you. Second, a customer might share a piece of your content, and his or her friend might see
it and become intrigued enough to follow you. Either way, you’re stuck waiting outside until that
person decides to let you in. Even Facebook’s search engine, Open Graph, only allows you access to
stories and conversations that have been publicly shared. Everyone else is off-limits.
Twitter users, however, have an open-door policy (except for a very limited number of private
profiles)—they use the platform knowing their tweets are public. In fact, that’s the draw. People on
Twitter are looking for attention; they welcome the spontaneous conversations that can ensue from a
tweet. Strangers from around the world, many of whom will never meet in person, have been able to
build robust online communities based on nothing more than a mutually shared interest in seahorses or
wrestling. And people love how Twitter has allowed companies to enhance their customer service. If
they want to get any brand’s attention, all they have to do is mention its name and they’ll get a
response, because that brand is out there, using Twitter to help it communicate with its customers and
build community.
Actually, that last bit is wishful thinking. Many companies are still only half-heartedly paying
attention to the online conversations people have about them, thus relinquishing control over how
their brand is perceived and allowing the competition to step in and shape the conversation in its
favor. Fortunately, there’s a book available that offers detailed explanations of why and how Twitter
can be one of a business’s most powerful customer service tools. It’s my last book, The Thank You
Economy. Read it, it’s good.*
All (half) kidding aside, Twitter is a marketer’s dream come true because it allows you to initiate
a relationship with your customer. It’s still the only platform where you can jump into a conversation
unannounced and no one thinks you’re a stalker. Here, you don’t have to wait for anyone to give you
permission to show how much you care. At any time, you can use the powerful Twitter search engine
to find people who are talking about topics related to your business, even if only tangentially, and
respond, adding your perspective and humor—and context—to the conversation.
It wouldn’t take much imagination for an office furniture retailer to engage with people who
mention the company name, or words like work, employee, employer, of ice, desk, Aeron, printer,
scanner, and other office-related terms. Think of all the interesting ways it could engage with people
with these words on their mind, however: deadline, backache, fluorescent, happy hour, raise,
promotion, weekend, swivel, or clutter.
Using Twitter Search this way helps you find storytelling opportunities with people who either
already know about you, or who have expressed interest in topics related to your product or service.But what about all those consumers out there who would love you if they only knew you existed?
Twitter makes it possible to reach them, too. You just have to know how to ride the cultural zeitgeist.
TRENDJACKING
In this chatty, 24-7 online culture, there is no better resource than Twitter trends for creating the realtime
context as well as the up-to-date content so imperative to staying relevant. Twitter’s trendtracking
ability is one of social media’s most powerful yet underused tools. You can set your account
to track worldwide, national, or even regional trends. Learning to jab with trends gives you
tremendous power. You can tailor content to any situation or demographic, you can spark interest in
your product or service among people outside your core group of followers, and you can scale your
caring. Best of all, you can piggyback on other people’s content, giving you a reprieve from having to
think up fresh creative day after day. You’ll still put out original content, but in this case, your content
is the context you use to tell your story.
The night before I began writing this chapter, the television show 30 Rock aired its series finale.
When I went to Twitter the next day, as I expected, there it was in the list of top-ten trending topics
for the United States. It seemed to me that if consumers felt like talking about 30 Rock, marketers
should be scrambling to tell their story within the context of 30 Rock, too. Could talking about a
defunct television show really help you sell more candy, crowbars, or cheese puffs? It could if you’re
creative enough. If you were a brand trying to ride the 30 Rock wave, the trick would be to look for
the unexpected connections, not the obvious ones. Here’s one: seven. The show aired for seven years.
Has your company been in business for seven years? Do you hope to do something for seven years?
Do you have seven in your company name? One brand does: 7 For All Mankind, maker of premium
denim clothing—sometimes nicknamed “sevens”—often worn by Hollywood celebrities. Curious to
see how the brand capitalized on the Twittersphere’s free gift to their marketing department, I
decided to check out their recent tweets.
A look on the 7 For All Mankind (@7FAM) Twitter page the day after the end of 30 Rock
revealed some light customer engagement—which is more than some companies manage, so kudos to
them—a number of retweets sharing the nice things people have said about them or their clothing line
—not so great, because that’s birdiebragging, and too many brands are doing it—and a stream of
traditional right hooks, such as “Love a good leather tee,” with a link to their product page. But
nowhere was there any indication that the brand had a clue about what was going on outside the
world of fashion. It was a little ironic—is there any other industry that lives for trends like fashion?
One of the most successful television shows of the decade just finished a seven-year run, and 7 For
All Mankind didn’t even mention it. What a waste. They can talk to denim lovers every day, but on
this day they had a perfect opportunity to tell their story to people who weren’t even thinking about
denim, and they let it pass. More distressingly, they seem to be letting all of these opportunities go by.
They didn’t just opt not to ride 30 Rock; their Twitter stream revealed that they weren’t riding any
news or current events, except the ones they created themselves through sweepstakes, giveaways, and
sales.
7 For All Mankind is a booming company that sells a great product or it wouldn’t have the cult
following it has garnered in the decade it’s been in business. And although its Twitter profile is
lacking in cultural relevance, the brand does make a serious effort to engage with its followers andstay on top of the conversation around its product. But that’s Twitter 101, à la 2008. By now they
should be doing much, much more. It’s fortunate that the company is such a fashion powerhouse
(which is also why I thought they could handle a little constructive criticism); if it were smaller and
just starting out, a habit of ignoring all the opportunities to tell its story outside the parameters of
denim or fashion could hurt it. Consumers don’t live in a fashion bubble; why should a clothing
company?
PROMOTED TWEETS
Creating context around trending hashtags only requires an investment of time, but buying a promoted
tweet can be a great investment, too. On the same day that 30 Rock trended, so did #GoRed, because
the American Heart Association sponsored National Wear Red Day to raise awareness around the
fight against heart disease. Above the hashtag, there was an ad for Tide laundry detergent saying, “It’s
crazy how Tide gets rid of tough stains, but what about the stains you want to save?” Aha. Color.
With #GoRed, Tide saw an opportunity to bring attention to its color-saving capabilities. That’s a
clever use of a hashtag. It was micro, it was inexpensive, and it made an impression. Think about that.
Consumers are spending 10 percent of their time on mobile and there is no more mobile platform than
Twitter. Yet for all the consumer attention Twitter attracts, placing an ad there still only costs lunch
money compared with the price of a television ad. That was a smart use of Tide’s media dollars. So
many companies could have taken advantage of that opportunity. Where was Crayola? What about
Target, with its big red bull’s-eye? Or Red Envelope?
USING TRENDS TO THROW RIGHT HOOKS
Trending topics can be names or current events, but they can also be memes—words and phrases that
have gone viral in the public sphere. These are low-hanging fruit, perfect storytelling fodder for any
brand or business, especially local companies looking for a fun, creative way to differentiate
themselves from their competitor.
On one of the days I was working on this chapter, the fifth-trending topic on Twitter was
#sometimesyouhaveto. You can’t get a better lead-in for a right hook. Literally anyone could adapt it
to his or her needs:
A cheese shop could say, “#Sometimesyouhaveto eat a slice of Cabot clothbound Cheddar.”
A fitness club could say, “#Sometimesyouhaveto use the sauna as incentive.”
A lawyer could say, “#Sometimesyouhaveto call a lawyer to make your problem go away.”
Taking advantage of hashtags is a great way for small businesses to get attention. That trending
hashtag is getting clicked by tens of thousands of people. There is no reason why someone won’t spot
your version, like it, and go to your profile page to see what else you have to say. Once he’s there, he
can see the whole story you’ve been telling about yourself with your steady stream of jabs and
occasional right hooks. He decides to follow you. Maybe he needs a lawyer. Maybe he has reason to
believe that one day he will need a lawyer. Regardless, you are now that much closer to gaining a
new customer when the time is right.
It could happen for a DJ in Miami named DJ Monte Carlo. While I was clicking on this trendinghashtag, I spotted his tweet: “#SometimesYouHaveTo forgive those who hurt you but never forget
what it taught you.”
I liked that. It hit my emotional center. I decided to follow him, and he wound up in my Twitter
stream, where my colleague Sam could see it. I’m not a big clubgoer, but Sam is. Maybe Sam decided
to follow DJ Monte Carlo, too. And maybe, in six months, Sam will be scrolling through his Twitter
feed and he’ll see Monte Carlo throw a right hook announcing that he’s spinning at a club in New
York City that night. And maybe Sam will decide to go, too.
Get it? This is not a far-fetched scenario; it’s how Twitter culture works every day. So get
creative, have fun, and start experimenting with creating content on the spot, because the trending
topics you see one minute will be gone the next. They have short life spans.
Something else to realize is that just because a topic is not one of the top-ten trends on Twitter
doesn’t mean it’s not worth paying attention to. The Twitter demographic skews hip and urban, but it
doesn’t represent the only people talking online. You want to pay attention to what the rest of the
world is interested in, too. Look for clues on Google trends. It skews young as well, just like all
online data, but it reflects a broader population. During the 2013 U.S. Open golf tournament, the
hashtag “#usopen” was, unsurprisingly, trending on Twitter. In response, KPMG Mickelson, the
“official Twitter account for Phil Mickelson’s hat,” promoted a tweet to followers of the hashtag,
suggesting that golf fans honor their dads on Father’s Day by donating to a charitable anti-illiteracy
campaign by buying a blue Phil Mickelson hat. KPMG Mickelson didn’t actually use the hashtag
“#usopen” (in fact, if they’re not an official event sponsor, their legal department may not have let
them use the hashtag) and yet, through strategic sponsoring, they came up as the top result for anyone
checking that hashtag. They were smart about the hashtag they did use, too#—fathersday.*
This example shows that KPMG Mickelson did something too many businesses don’t do on
Twitter: They listened. It’s extremely hard to create a trending hashtag and bring people to you. It’s
far better to listen, find out what’s trending, and bring yourself to the people. In this case, golf fans
were already having the conversation. Promoting the tweet ensured that KPMG Mickelson’s message
became part of that conversation. It was doubly smart to include it in the Father’s Day stream, as
well.This praise comes with two caveats:
1. Amazingly, even while KPMG Mickelson correctly joined trending conversations, they also
unnecessarily included the hashtag “#PhilsBlueHat” in their tweet. How did their own invented
hashtag do? A total of three people used it in the three days following KPMG’s original tweet.
That’s embarrassing.
2. The link in the tweet doesn’t actually take consumers to make a purchase. It goes to KPMG’s
Phil’s Blue Hat website, where it takes yet another click to buy the hat. Adding extra steps after
a call to action wastes the consumer’s time.
Whether you jab or right hook, marketing moves like that prove that you’re up to date, that you’ve
got a sense of humor, and most of all, that you’re paying attention. You’d be amazed at how far that
goes when customers are looking for someone with whom to do business.
CHOOSE HASHTAGS CAREFULLY
There’s a skill to choosing hashtags. You can’t just cover all your bases by tacking a bunch of
hashtags onto a sentence. They won’t work if they don’t feel native to Twitter and natural to your
brand. For example, Twitter is a hotbed of irony, but if your natural tone is generally serious andthoughtful, going ironic with your hashtags or suddenly adopting hipster vocabulary is just going to
make you look like a poser. Being cool has nothing to do with age; it has to do with how solid your
identity is. Do not pretend to be anyone other than who you are. That said, don’t take yourself too
seriously, either. Be human. If you’re not comfortable talking pop culture, find someone in your
organization or partner with an agency that is. Whatever you do, however, stay true to yourself. Do
not pretend to be cooler than you are. Do not be the guy who hollered out, “Raise the roof!” a year too
late. That’s how it sounds when you use hashtags and trending topics as indiscriminate marketing
tactics, instead of incorporating select ones into your conversation. Listen. Entertain, through humor
or provocation.
Entrepreneurs and small businesses may see the amount of work that has to go into keeping up on
Twitter and wonder if they shouldn’t just give up and go home. There’s no way they can compete with
larger companies that have extensive budgets and staff. A person has to sleep sometime. Yes, creating
real-time micro-content is an enormous job. Yes, start-ups and small businesses will have to be
selective about which trends are worth their time and money. But putting your effort into that kind of
thinking will do a heck of a lot more for your bottom line than sitting around like a dope waiting for
customers to come to you. And it’s way better than tweeting content that no one sees or cares about.
As a small business, you can gain an edge over larger companies when it comes to being nimble
and authentic, two imperatives to successful Twitter marketing. Because you haven’t let your
personality get squashed by a PR or legal department, you have more freedom to say what you think,
to look for humor in unexpected places, and to be self-deprecating. That last one works like a charm.
I just admitted in an interview for Inc. magazine that I peed in my bed until I was twelve years old.
Can you imagine anyone in a Fortune 500 company getting that personal or irreverent? Neither can I.
People love it when you acknowledge your humanity and vulnerability. You may be a lightweight up
against a heavyweight, but you can be the lightweight who wakes up at 3 A.M., drinks a few raw eggs,
and puts in two hours at the gym before the competition’s alarm clock goes off. People will notice
your effort, and it will make a difference.
SCALING THE UNSCALABLE
To see what that kind of effort looks like, take a look at the conversation Levi Lentz had with Green
Mountain Coffee (full disclosure: Green Mountain Coffee Roasters is a VaynerMedia client at the
time of this book’s publication). Green Mountain Coffee was poking its nose far beyond its
comfortable coffee burrow; otherwise it never would have seen Lentz’s tweet. All Lentz tweeted was
“ ‘Say Hey’ by Michael Franti is one of my favorite songs.”
To his surprise, he received a reply from the verified Green Mountain Coffee Twitter account,
saying, “We love that song! Isn’t it motivational?”
On the surface, there is no connection between the topic of coffee and the bouncy love song Lentz
was listening to. Green Mountain’s jab is pure storytelling context—we’re a brand that likes the same
music you do. Now, what Lentz didn’t know was that Michael Franti was working on a fair trade
campaign with Green Mountain Coffee, so there was, in fact, a reason why Green Mountain was so
interested in engaging with his tweet. However, the fact that he wasn’t weirded out by the fact that a
brand would contact him to talk about music proves how receptive people are to brands that reach out
to consumers.Coffee was not mentioned until Lentz brought it up, politely telling Green Mountain that he was
just learning to like coffee, so he had never tried their products, but that he would definitely do so
now. Green Mountain made some inquiries into his coffee tastes and followed up with a few
recommendations. The conversation ended with Green Mountain asking Lentz to DM his mailing
address so they could send him a Michael Franti CD, just because.
Lentz knew he was being marketed to, but he didn’t care. Out of the blue, a brand had struck up an
engaging conversation, given him some information he was looking for, and offered to send him a gift.
Of course he wrote about it on his blog. Then he wrote about it again a few days later when he
received the CD in the mail, as well as another package containing a handwritten thank-you note for
writing about the company on his blog, a coffee mug, and a sample of coffee.
By watching out for opportunities to introduce itself, Green Mountain Coffee garnered extensive
earned media and gained a lifelong customer by being personable, charming, generous, and above all,
real, with a perfect stranger. As any good matchmaker knows, when two people are reluctant to meet,
you sometimes need to find a way to firmly nudge them into the same room so they can realize how
compatible they are with one another. For those companies who learn to spin compelling stories from
the threads of news and information floating through the Twittersphere, this social media platform is
the most indefatigable consumer-to-brand connector that ever existed.
COLOR COMMENTARY
LACOSTE: Interrupting Its Own Conversation
Lacoste is a brand with a tremendous amount of staying power. I loved Lacoste’s alligator on
my shirts when I was a little kid, and recently I’ve rediscovered the brand and started wearing
it again. Reinventing yourself to your fans is no small feat, so kudos to Lacoste for pulling it off.
Unfortunately, that’s the only praise they’re going to get from me, because this is one of the
worst examples of a poorly thrown right hook in this book. It’s laughably bad. I know this
because I laughed my face off when I saw it.Treats the consumer like an idiot: In the text, Lacoste asks, “If you could do one thing
today, what would it be?” That’s a great way to invite fans to engage. In a parallel universe,
fans are posting comments like “Sleep!” “Ride a paddle boat,” “Travel to Mars,” “Promote
whirled peas,” and in all likelihood, “Shop!”—which would be an ideal moment for the
brand to respond directly to that consumer and build a relationship. It would be a great
opportunity for the brand to show off the personality of its fans, which in turn should reflect
favorably on its own persona. But in this universe, where someone at Lacoste isn’t thinking,
the brand halts the conversation before it even starts by answering its own question. It’s as if
Lacoste didn’t trust that its fans would answer the way it wanted them to. Remember, it’s
“Give, give, give, give, give . . . ask,” not, “Give, give, give, give, give . . . demand!”
Pointless link: Like Zara on page 52, Lacoste seems to think that its website should be the
hub of all its media outreach. If there’s anything that brands should take away from this
book, it’s that there is no central hub anymore. Consumers are going to be coming through all
kinds of portals, and forcing them to enter through the same door every time is going to make
them tire of you. When customers click on this Twitter link, they’re not taken to a special
sale or even a promotion for the seasonal trends. They’re just taken straight to the general
website, which at the time of this writing features a blank-faced preteen.
Lacoste has more than 370,000 followers at the time of this writing. Of those followers, two
saw fit to retweet this post. The link itself only received eighty-eight clicks. That’s as bad as it
gets. It’s posts like this that are responsible for all the pointless noise on Twitter that makes it
harder for the great content to get noticed. I can’t even bring myself to say, “See you later,
alligator,” because if I see more of these kind of tweets later I may abandon the brand
altogether.
DUNKIN’ DONUTS: Sweet, but Out of Date
This is a charming, lightweight jab to sell iced coffee. The copy is the appropriate length, the
tone is right, and the image is clever. But I have to question why the creatives at Dunkin’
Donuts decided to turn their iced coffee cup into a midcentury relic.
Anachronistic image: They would have come across as a much more modern brand if
they had depicted the cup with an iPhone charger coming out of it instead of a two-pronged
plug that could belong to an elderly uncle’s bedside table lamp. It’s possible that Dunkin’
Donuts purposely used an old-fashioned plug to speak to the older demographic that
frequents its stores, but if that’s the case, they’re speaking the right language in the wrong
country, because the demographic that grew up living in two-pronged-plug homes doesn’t
have a particularly strong showing on Twitter (three-pronged grounded outlets became a
required safety feature for new homes in the early 1960s). If it is possible for “Who is Paul
McCartney?” to be a trending topic on Twitter during the 2012 Grammys, then it is equallypossible that half the audience that follows Dunkin’ Donuts on Twitter wouldn’t know what
the heck that thing is sticking out of the cup.
One more criticism: The tweet is signed “JG.” I understand that Dunkin’ Donuts is trying
to humanize their brand, but in my opinion this is the wrong way to do it. You’re putting your
business at risk when you let anyone except your logo or brand build equity on these public
platforms. What happens when JG moves on to Starbucks or McDonald’s and people start
asking, “Hey, where’s JG?” Your brand needs a unified front and voice. This doesn’t mean
you don’t appreciate the efforts of the people who work for you; it means that you have to
ensure that everyone is working to build up your brand equity, not their own.
ADIDAS: Slam Dunk
This Adidas Originals right hook is tremendous (yeah, the shoes are kind of whack, but . . . ). I
love where Adidas went with this for a few reasons.Cool picture: They used a terrific picture of their product, clean but exploding with
vibrant color. It’s the kind of picture that will make a consumer scrolling through their
stream stop in his tracks and take the right hook.
Correct tone: The copy is strong and builds up the story. It’s written in the voice of the
brand and target demo, even when they hit with the direct right hook, “Get ’em here.” Often
brands will write their copy with all the right slang and swag for a strong delivery, but when
they go for the formal ask, that right hook, they switch to more formal corporate-speak, “You
can buy them here.” I love how Adidas carried the appropriate tone all the way through the
right hook with “Get ’em here.” Then they got right to the point, linking straight to the
product page, not their home page or some other secondary page that would have required
more hunting and clicking.
You want to be gentle and subtle when you’re jabbing, but when it’s time to ask for
business, go for it. Don’t be bashful. Own it.
Good job, Adidas. Very, very, very well executed.
HOLLISTER: Smart Strategy Gone Wrong
This is a really interesting case study because it represents a lot of smart strategy and a lot of
awful execution all in one place.
Brave creative: Hollister deserves credit for understanding the power of Internet memes
to reach a young demographic. In response to the huge popularity of planking—choosing a
random location in which to lie facedown on the ground with your arms at your side—andits little brother, owling—choosing a random location in which to perch like, you guessed it,
an owl—Hollister decided to try to spawn a movement toward “guarding”—holding your
hands up in front of your eyes like you’re holding binoculars. They went for a big right hook
in asking their community to tag and engage with their meme. It’s a bold move, and I love it!
The problem is, though, that it’s ridiculously hard for a brand to create a meme. It’s not a
particularly practical move, and consumers don’t tend to follow it. In general, brands should
be following memes, not creating them. But Hollister tried, which is admirable.
Clumsy hashtag: Where they really went wrong is in choosing their hashtag. At the time
that I first reviewed this tweet, a click on #guarding showed that security guards use it, and
so do sixteen-year-old basketball players. Hollister doesn’t own the “guarding” concept,
and so they should have chosen a more distinct hashtag to bring attention to the meme.
Busy visuals: Then there’s the photo they used. It’s colorful, but small and cluttered.
There are too many things vying for your eye and the text is cramped. Hollister’s story could
have been told through a tweet in a shorter, more streamlined way with a single up-close
picture of a pair of pretty boys’ faces with the hashtag beneath.
SURF TACOS: Feeding New Platforms
This isn’t the greatest jab of all time, but I thought it would be a good idea to show some
lightweight moves that won’t revolutionize the social media world but do provide some
examples of easy things you can do so you don’t feel pressured to create masterpiece after
masterpiece.Good cross-pollination: Surf Taco has a respectable following on Twitter of about 6,400
followers. They have about 500 on Instagram. By pushing an Instagram picture on Twitter,
they’re wisely using their bigger pool of followers to increase the size of their smaller one.
This is a strategy more people need to follow, although pushing Instagram to Twitter worked
better before competition between the two meant that Twitter cut off seamless Instagram
integration, so that it would no longer load natively. However, when you are trying to
develop a following on a new platform, whether it’s Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, or
whatever we’ll see in the future, it’s important to use the platform where you have the most
data to drive traffic to the new one (three years ago I was telling people to use their email
service to drive traffic to Facebook). Siphoning data from place to place is an excellent
strategic move to build awareness of your presence on a new platform.
Appropriate aesthetic: Surf Taco also clearly understands the aesthetic of Instagram.
This isn’t a particularly artistic or exciting shot, but at least they’re not using a stock photo
or a glossy product picture. It’s a casual, natural scene from a real place, and based on the
solid engagement it received, even from a relatively small community, it resonated with
followers.
They also knew enough about Twitter users to include a hashtag, and a good one, too, though
it might have been smart to include one or two broad hashtags, like “#baseball,” to try to earn
even greater visibility.
All in all, not a bad play by a small New Jersey business.
CHUBBIES SHORTS: It’s All About the VoiceUltimately, success in social media boils down to three things: understanding the nuances of
your platform, using a distinct voice, and driving your business goals. Chubbies does all three
in this, one of my favorite pieces of micro-content in this book.
The most powerful thing about this piece is the voice, which carries through this content
from beginning to end. It’s young, wry, irreverent, and entertaining—exactly what the demo is
looking for when it comes to Twitter. The tweet itself shows that the brand understands the
nuances of this platform. It is brief and spare, nothing but two hashtags that link to a meme that
offers humorous suggestions of things that are superior, in this case a cat named Pablo Picatso,
to their competitor’s product, cargo shorts. It’s a ridiculous and funny comparison. Now, why
did this meme work, when Hollister couldn’t get much traction with #guarding? The hashtag.
No one but Chubbies has any reason to create hashtags like #CargoEmbargo or #SOTO—Skies
Out Thighs Out—so they have complete ownership. The hashtags are distinct enough to gain
cachet to those people who decide to run with them. Chubbies didn’t blow it by linking out to a
product page, either.
You want to see ROI on social media? Tell a story that’s good enough to get people to buy
stuff. My creative team and I were impressed with this brand’s commitment to upholding a
strong voice and its attention to the nuances of the platform. That raised our brand awareness,
which got us talking about the shorts, which made us a little obsessed, which led me to buying
eleven pairs, one for each member of the team. The VaynerMedia team’s thighs will be out in
Chubbies style.
BULGARI US: A PR Company Gets in Its Own WayWhen my parents came to this country in the late 1970s, they became obsessed with Elizabeth
Taylor. In fact, I’m confident that my grandmother’s first two words in English were “Elizabeth
Taylor.” So I have affection for the icon, which is why I hate to see her poorly treated. This
was surely a great event, melding two high-end, luxury brands. Unfortunately, Bulgari didn’t
commit to honoring Ms. Taylor online as much as they did offline.
Live tweeting events can get obnoxious when the only value the tweets bring are to the PR
company trying to get impressions. That’s what’s going on with this tweet. The picture is so
weak, an intern hiding behind a potted plant could have taken it. We could have chosen to
criticize any of the twenty-three tweets they put out throughout the day but this one deserves
special attention for being particularly terrible. It’s hard to even see what’s going on. Try this:
Turn this page back, then quickly return to this page. Can you tell what you’re looking at in a
split second? You have to click on the link and look on a big PC screen, and then stick your
nose close to that screen, to get an idea of what the sumptuous flower arrangements on the table
looked like. But no one is going to make that effort, nor should they, because the picture holds
zero value, either to the consumer or to the brand.
I do give Bulgari credit for mentioning the catering company. It shows heart for an
international brand to publicly acknowledge a company with a 200-person Twitter following.
NETFLIX: Simplicity WorksThis is a perfectly executed jab, launched just days after Netflix announced that fifteen
episodes of the long-awaited fourth season of the cult television show hit Arrested
Development would air exclusively on their platform. Its success lies in packing a lot of power
into a very simple package.
The picture is a clear reference to the show’s season-three finale, when a character quits the
family company. And the copy is timely and clever. “Hey Brother,” a line frequently heard on
the show, gave Netflix the perfect way to ride the hashtag wave of National Sibling Day. For
the record, almost every day of the year has been designated an unofficial national day of
something-or-other—use this knowledge well.
AMC: Calls to NowhereThis tweet feels schizophrenic—“Retweet if you love The Rock!NO!Watch this video!NO!Buy
tickets!” In 140 characters, AMC managed to make three calls to action. That’s an
accomplishment, but not one to be proud of. When you’re asking for three calls to action, you’re
asking for no calls to action. The customer spotting this mishmash of links and short text coming
through a mobile screen had to have been extremely confused. There’s just no way to know
where to focus our attention first. AMC often makes some strong social media moves, but
unfortunately, much like the GI Joe movies, this one sucked.
NBA: Smart Partnering
The NBA threw a great right hook here to raise awareness of their partnership with Kia and
their joint MVP awards. Every decision shows finesse, from keeping the tweet streamlined and
clear, to capitalizing the word “you” to help connect with their community. They repeatedly
reinforced the Kia brand, beginning with the inclusion of the Kia Twitter handle in the tweet, to
framing the NBA.com landing page—which opens with an article and photo announcing LeBron
James as the winner of the MVP Kia Awards—in bold red with the Kia logo. I don’t know for
sure that Kia paid the NBA for this fully integrated social media drive, but if they did, it was
money well spent.
GOLF PIGEON: Confusing Quantity with Quality
If you’re just starting out or you have a small consumer base and you want to trendjack to
amplify your reach, one strategic and valuable way to do it is to use Twitter’s ad platform and
buy a keyword that will turn your tweet into the first or second result when a consumer searches
a term on Twitter. But one thing I’m always stressing is that it’s not the quantity of impressions
that counts, it is the quality. You can tweet out to a million people, but if your tweet stinks or is
irrelevant to them, it’s entirely possible that of that million people who saw your tweet, a half
million of them now hate your product or your brand. The day this tweet went out, Lionel
Messi, the best soccer player in the world, must have scored his seven thousandth spectaculargoal of the season, and his name was trending. Golf Pigeon must have thought that if soccer fans
were talking about Messi, they might like to talk about golf, too. Wait, that doesn’t even make
sense. Theoretically, soccer and golf can sometimes overlap. I guess. I mean, sure, they’re both
sports. One explanation for this strange pairing might be that sometimes Twitter pushes
promoted tweets into related hashtags to deliver more impressions. Golf Pigeon might not have
chosen to promote against #messi, in which case they’re off the hook. But if they did, they
didn’t do themselves any favors. It might have been a smart move to try to garner some
crossover awareness this way back in the 1980s, when there were a limited number of channels
on which to reach sports fans. But in today’s targeted world, there’s no reason to waste dollars
marketing to a soccer community about golf. The company would have seen a lot more upside
had they waited for the Masters and tripled down on trending topics that were more aligned
with their brand and their community.
HOLIDAY INN: A One-Way ConversationSo many public replies, so little value. Retweeting nice things said about you to your entire
consumer base has only one name. It’s called bragging. Doing it nonstop is called obnoxious.
From April 21 to April 23, 2013, Holiday Inn spent most of its time retweeting the nice things
people said about them to all thirty thousand of their fans, when instead they should have spent
five minutes forming a deeper relationship with the fans who took the time to praise them. By
the way, any time a brand of this size is following more people than follow it back, it speaks to
just how severely they are misusing their Twitter account. It’s a sign that they’re gaming the
system—following people in hopes that they will follow back. It’s a cheap tactic.
Poor Holiday Inn is taking the heat in this book, but retweeting fan praise is a mistake that
thousands of brands make every day, probably because PR companies love to tell their clients
that it’s a smart move. I’m telling you, it isn’t. Retweets of this nature have little to no value to
anyone who follows you. It’s truly poor form, not to mention incredibly boring for your
followers.
FIFA: Breaking News
As I’ve said, businesses that want to compete in social media today need to embrace a dual
identity. They will of course be the purveyors of a product or service, but they must also learn
to act like a media company. This post illustrates exactly what that looks like. EA Sports FIFA
is a video game for soccer lovers. But with this post, the brand shows that it understands that if
it is to compete, it must become much more.
The tweet went out to announce that the teams for the UEFA Champions League semifinals
had just been confirmed. Five or six years ago, soccer fans would have found this news out
when it appeared at the bottom of the ESPN screen, and anyone who missed it would have read
about it the next day in the newspaper. But on this day, a video game broke the news, if not to
the world, then at least to anyone who followed it on Twitter. What did this jab do for the
brand? The number of retweets was more than five hundred. Anyone who got their news here
first turned right around and retweeted it to all of their followers. All those fans and their
followers gave EA Sports FIFA the news credit. In addition, the brand reaped the rewards of
nice levels of engagement, brand awareness, brand affinity, and probably tens if not hundreds of
new followers—all by leading the media conversation around their genre. Those new
followers represent many people who might be receptive when EA Sports FIFA throws a righthook in the form of an offer, coupon, or other call to action.
TACO BELL: Getting It
This one is impressive, a truly awesome example of skillful trendjacking. #ThoughtsInBed was
trending. Taco Bell jumped in and offered their answer in their typical snarky, cheeky, edgy
voice. Obviously their efforts resonated, because out of only about 430,000 followers, they
received almost 13,000 retweets. Why did the tweet perform so well? Because Taco Bell did
exactly what they were supposed to do—they respected the platform, and they talked in the
same voice as their consumer. They understand that the Twitter demo is a youth demo, and if
you look at their stream, you can see that day in, day out, they’re reaching out to their followers
and consistently making contact, building enormous brand affinity in the process. They deserve
the highest level of praise I can offer: They get it.
SKITTLES: Hashtag Heaven
A lot of examples in this book make me want to cry, but this one made me smile. It probably
made you smile, too. It’s cute, it’s funny, it sounds like a Skittles lover. The really smart thing
they did, though, was to link their micro-content to an evergreen hashtag. It’s a hashtag that
never dies, its jokey, effervescent content ensuring that it remains relevant to anyone looking for
a little humor. If Skittles keeps tweeting out micro-content like this, it has a long, exciting social
media life ahead of it.CHRIS GETHARD: Hard Work That Will Pay Off
Comedians are an interesting demo on Twitter because an ungodly number of them use it to
preview jokes, spread awareness, and throw right hooks like asking people to buy their DVD
or come to a show. This upcoming comedian out of Brooklyn, however, has hit on the right
formula. He tells jokes, of course, but he also retweets and engages, responding to and talking
to fans and letting them know that he’s paying attention and appreciating the time they take to let
him know what they think. He’s putting in a ton of effort that will result in big residual gains
once he has a special or he decides to start throwing more right hooks.
TWITTER: Clueless
Twitter helped my career in a huge way, so it’s with a heavy heart that I have to criticize them
for their stunning lack of engagement. They are in a constant state of push, putting out selfserving
announcement after announcement, and make zero effort to build community. On June 6,2013, they were in full-on brag mode, announcing their new partnership with WPP. That the
platform itself has no idea how to natively storytell proves that we are still living in the early
days of the grand social media timeline. Twitter has the capability to listen to people talk all
day long. When it first bought Vine and millions of people were tweeting raves about the new
product, why couldn’t it even muster up the occasional “Thank you”? How could the marketing
team not realize the importance of establishing an emotional connection with its users? If they
had, maybe some of the people who flocked to Instagram after it launched video sharing might
have stayed loyal to Vine, instead of sending it into a downward spiral. The world is
emotional. If Twitter itself is not listening and reaching out on Twitter, how can they expect
anyone to feel strongly about the platform? I have a lot of friends at Twitter and I’m curious to
hear their opinions when they read this critique. I’m sure they’ll have plenty to say.
SPHERO: Nerding It Up
Ilove this in a big way. It’s a perfect example of a brand that understands its audience and how
to tell its story. They understand exactly who would buy a ball controlled by an iPhone. They
used a video from a BuzzFeed link, which shows they speak their demo’s native tongue. They
get the audience, the medium, the language, the story. Even someone who didn’t belong to the
targeted demo would think this is cool.
Many start-ups struggle to tell good stories because instead of building community, they’re
focusing on fund-raising and getting an article about themselves published in TechCrunch. It’s
hard for a new business to strike the right balance among so many competing priorities. Sphero
deserves kudos for managing to do it when so many others put it off. Truly, this is a perfect
execution.
FLEURTY GIRL: Flirting with BrillianceA lot of people reading this book are small business owners with one-store locations. Fleurty
Girl has five stores, but that’s still small, and the owner’s commitment to her community, both
online and in-store, is impressive. Born and bred in New Orleans, owner Lauren Thom throws
around acronyms like NOLA; she knows about the peach festival in Ruston; she retweeted to a
New Orleans Saints player—she’s speaking the native language. She probably hasn’t built up a
huge base yet, but she’s working hard toward it. I wish more local businesses would put her
kind of energy into their media. There are ways she could add a little more spice and flair to
her tweets to increase her retweet value. She could add hashtags, for example, to ignite
emotions or laughs. When she tweeted, “I love peaches,” an appropriate hashtag might have
been #peachesfillthebelly. You need to do anything you can to get people to smile and burn a
slightly deeper impression in your consumer’s mind. Instead of wishing Darren Sproles a happy
birthday, she could have looked up his age and matched it to the Saints player who wore that
number during the 2012 season, so that the greeting becomes something a little more
memorable, such as “Happy Ryan Steed!” Something like that would have been fun. I think
she’ll get there.
SHAKESPEARE’S PIZZA: Delicious Local FlavorI’m happy to praise yet another small business that has made a strong commitment to putting out
good micro-content, and has a talented writer creating their copy, too. Pay attention—the third
tweet seems like a simple response to Earth Day, but look at the clever hashtag. That hashtag
shows that this company gets the psyche of a Twitter user, that it understands that it’s those little
moments that make consumers go “Ha!” that compel them to retweet to friends and put your
brand in their feeds. Shakespeare’s Pizza could have paid for a banner ad to get an impression,
but no one would have cared.
The second tweet is on point, too. Anyone between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four is
going to be all in. Heck, it will appeal to anyone with the mentality of a sixteen- to twenty-fouryear-old—you
know who you are, hit me up on Twitter. Shakespeare’s tweets prove that a
combination of creative writing and a deep understanding of what brings people to Twitter will
lead a brand to overindex. They also made me hungry. For the record, I like mushrooms.
